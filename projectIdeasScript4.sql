(' Coffee Processing :Roasting, Grinding & Packing',' Coffee beans are sold to the consumer either as “raw” beans or roasted, ground (made to powder) and packed. Usually roasted coffee is sold to hotels, coffee shops, restaurants, pastries, etc. and “raw” coffee beans are sold to households where the roasting aspect of coffee making is as important as the coffee drinking itself. This project idea is to establish coffee roasting … enterprises in the Amhara region where roasting of coffee on commercial scale is virtually unknown. ' ,
' ',
'The main consumers of roasted coffee are restaurants, hotels, coffee and tea shops, etc. While there are hundred of coffee roasting, grinding and packing enterprises in Addis Ababa and in areas south of Addis Ababa, there are no such enterprises in the Amhara region. Like the “raw” coffee, the Amhara Region also imports roasted coffee from other regions of the country. With 2.1 million people living in the urban areas of the Region, the consumption of processed coffee (roasted and ground) is substantial. It is understandable why the Region imports the “green” coffee beans, but it does not give economic sense to import the processed coffee while it is possible to do the processing in the region. The present consumption of processed coffee in the urban centers of the Amhara Region is estimated to be about 4015 tons, and this consumption level will grow with further urbanization and increased population. ' ,
'The principal raw materials are coffee beans; and the beans will be imported from other parts of the country. Until the Region becomes self – sufficient in coffee production. ',
'Major processing stages include cleaning of the beans, grading, roasting grinding and packaging. Major machinery units will include cleaning machine, roasting, grinding and packing machines. ',
' More value added, promotes self sufficiency, saves financial resources',1,1),
(' Molasses Based Alcohol Production Plant',' Industrial alcohol is an important input in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and veterinary spirits, perfumes and alcoholic beverages. One major “raw material” for producing alcohol is molasses which is a by product of sugar factories. ', 
' ',
' Alcohol is in demand in pharmaceuticals, veterinary services, health care institutions such is health centers, clinics and hospitals, perfume producing factories, liquor producing beverage factories. Alcohol is also needed in households for emergency purposes, in barber shops and beauty salons. Many developing countries meet their alcohol requirements from imports. Molasses from which alcohol is produced is a by product of the country’s sugar factories. Domestic production of alcohol between 2000 and 2004 was on the average 14,400 hectoliters per year. On the other hand, average annual production of molasses during the same period was 50,300 tons; Molasses is used for alcohol production and as an ingredient in animal feed. Some portion of the product is exported. For a long time there has been a surplus in the production of molasses and the surplus product is dumped into streams or is used to maintain roads within the factory and plantation sites of the sugar factories.
All alcoholic beverages produced in the country are manufactured in and around Addis Ababa. These beverages are put in glass bottles and are distributed to all parts of the country near or far. The Amhara Region which is on the average about 500 km from Addis Ababa receives its share of alcoholic beverages from Addis Ababa. As the beverages are packed in glass bottles they are heavy, cumbersome and expensive to transport long distances. Between 2000 and 2004, the liquor consumption share of the Amhara Region was about 10,000 hecto liters per year on the average. Beverage products which use bottles for packaging are located near major consumer centers to avoid excessive transportation costs.
Currently, it is estimated that more than 20 thousand hector liter of ethyl alcohol per annum  is used in Ethiopia. Here, this figure is taken as a base for the future demand projection. And, in line with the economic growth, it is also assumed that for the coming ten years the annual utilization of ethanol will increase at 10 % per annum. Based on these assumptions, the future demand for ethyl alcohol is projected as follows.
These products are produced in different consumer centers and distributed regional or local markets. The liquor market in the Amhara region can justify the establishment of a liquor factory in the region. This factory will require alcohol as one of the major inputs. To supply the liquor factory with the required amount of alcohol, a factory that will refine molasses to produce alcohol will be needed. The raw material- molasses will be transported in big containers to the factory site to be used as input for the alcohol factory. The remaining part of the molasses will be used to produce animal feed which is in short supply in the region. Molasses for the alcohol factory will be transported from the existing factories until such a time that the Amhara Region establishes its own factory. The alcohol to be produced will not only used to make liquor; it will also be used for other purposes in health care institutions, barber shops, beauty salons, etc. ', 
'The main raw materials are molasses, sulphuric acid and nutritive salts (ammonia phosphate). For every 100 liters of alcohol distilled about 1.5 kgs of sulphuric acid and 0.35kg. of nutritive salts are required. The acids will be imported and the molasses will be obtained from domestic sources.',
 'The process of alcohol production is based on the fermentation of molasses and extracting the alcohol there from by using column distilleries. The molasses is diluted with water and allowed to ferment. From the fermented molasses, the alcohol is finally extracted. The required equipment and facilities include equipment for receiving and diluting molasses, pre-fermentation and fermentation equipment, distillation equipment, storage tanks, steam boiler and electric generating nit, laboratory equipment, truck mounted tanker for transporting the molasses.

(' Processing or Fruit-Based Drinks',' There are a number of fruit types from which drinks or juices can be made. The common fruits from which fruit drinks or juices are made are organizes, grapes, pineapples, mangoes, papayas and other fruits of the citrus family. The juices or drinks are consumed usually during breakfast time or in refreshment hours. Processed fruits and drinks are normally packed in cans, bottles, plastic pouches or even in cartons.', 
' ',
'Currently, there are three main sources for the supply of fruit-based drinks and juices in the country. The largest supply comes from households, snack shops, pastries, coffee shops, restaurants, hotels and “juice houses”. It is almost impossible to estimate the volume of supply from scattered sources. The other domestic source is Merti Fruits Processing Plant located in the Awash Valley. This plant has produced an average of about 1300 tons of fruit drinks per year between 1986 and 1995; and during this period production by the plant had grown by 1.5 percent per year. The third source of supply is import. During the last 15 years, because of related foreign exchange control, imports of fruits drinks and juices have been growing fast. Now all the so-called super-markets and even small and large grocery stores are filled with imported fruit drinks and juices. In fact, this has negative impact on domestic production. Some newly established “milk Processing” enterprises supply what they call “fruit juices” to the market. (How a milk, processing plant can produce fruit juice is not clear.) The main determining factors for the demand of fruit juices and drinks are income and population size especially urban population. Admittedly, consumption of fruit juices and drinks in the Amhara Region is confined to a small section of the urban population. If we assume only 20 percent of the 400,000 urban families in the Region consume fruit juices and drinks regularly, the size of consumers in the Region is about 80,000. if we assume that a family of five consumes at least two liters of fruit juice or drink every day, the annual consumption of these products in the Region is 58,400 tons = (80,000X2 lit. X 365/100Kgs; 1000 lits.=1000Kgs.). One can feel this is optimistic estimate. To be on the safe side, let us say the estimated demand is one-half of the above estimate. This leaves us with a potential demand of 26000 tons per year. This can justify the establishment of medium size fruit-based drinks and juices producing plant. (project ideas have proposed the establishment of citrus fruits plantations in the Region.) ',
 ' Citrus fruits plantations in the Region and outside the Region.',
 'It is assumed that orange juices and drinks will be the main products of the plant. The Process of producing these products require cleaning of the raw material (organs), warming the fruits peeling, juice extracting, pre-heating and cooling, centrifugalization, deaeration, seasoning, sterilization, filling, cooling, labeling and packing.The main plant and machinery required are, receiving line and bins, inspection, washing and sizing, juice, extractors, finishers, pasteurizer, filler and sealer, cooling machine, labeler, centrifuge, evaporator, vessels with pumps, boiler, conveying unit, laboratory, concentrate production machinery and equipment.

' Saves foreign exchange and regional financial resources, stimulates regional production of citrus fruits promotes self-sufficiency in food production',1,1),
(' Production of Malt for Breweries',' Malt is the major input to produce beer.  It is what is known in Amharic as “bikil”.  The raw material from which malt is made is malt barley which can be grown in many localities of the Region.  Basically, malt is prepared by soaking barley in water for a period for germination, drying it and making it into flour before it is used as an ingredient to make bear or whisky. ', 
'There are two large breweries in the Amhara Region (Dashen and Bati) established in the last 10 years.  These breweries either obtain their malt requirement from the Asella Malt Factory or they import it from abroad.  Most likely they import the malt.  This requires foreign exchange which has always been in short supply in our country.  The type of barley needed for malt production is being grown in Arsie and Bale.  This barley can be grown in the highland areas of the Amhara Region.  Hence it is possible to produce malt in the Region. ', 
' Domestic production of malt between 1999/200 and 2003/2004 was on the average 13,650 tons per year.  This production volume is perhaps one-half of the malt requirements of the existing breweries.  Subject to detail market study, the existing deficit in the supply for malt is estimated to be between 5000 to 8000 tons.  The proposed malt producing plant is to fill this supply gap and to make the Region self-sufficient in the production of malt.', 
' The raw material which is malt barley could be obtained from the high-land parts of the Region provided that malt barley seeds are distributed to farmers so that they grow the barley.', 
'Malt barely is fed into grading machines to obtain uniform malting parameters;  germination is carried out in “germinating boxes”, adding water from time to time to keep the product moisture constant.  The germinating process normally lasts five to six days; kilning process takes place; after clearing, the malt is stored in silos.  Main production machinery include barley intake and pre-cleaning, barley main cleaning and grading, germinating boxes, kiln conveyors, cooling plant, silos, etc. ','Saving in foreign exchange and regional financial resources, stimulating the farming sector of the Region, introduction of new skills and technology, self-sufficiency in this particular product.

(' Purified Water Bottling Plant',' Purified water has become popular among foreigners and high-income groups during the last 5 to 7 years. Now there are more than five purified water bottling plants in the country clustering in and around Addis Ababa. The product has in some areas become a conspicuous consumption item. ',
 ' When factory bottled purified water appeared in the market for the first time, many people doubted about the market success of the product because they believed that with low per capita income, not very many people will buy the product. But because of robust demand not only there is one bottling plant but more than 5 in a matter of six years. However, like many other factories, bottling plants of purified water are concentrated around Addis Ababa. Bottled water is one of those products which is expensive to transport long distances. Because purified water can be processed from springs, rivers, wells, etc., the bottling plant could be established any place where there are these water sources. So far, except for one or two bottling plants in North Shewa, there are no new purified water bottling plants in the Amhara Region. Consumers in the Region get their plastic bottled purified water from Addis Ababa which makes the price of the water almost twice that of Addis Ababa. The Region should be self-sufficient in the supply of purified water that people consume; and one or two bottling plants should be established in the region.',
 ' The main consumers of bottled purified water in the Amhara Region are the urban high-income groups and outsides who travel through the Region, such as tourists, businesspeople and civil servants. If we assume that at least five percent of the urban population (95,000) of the Region consumes one bottle of purified water per day, this amounts to an annual consumption of 35 million bottles which is more than one half of the production capacity of the Ambo Mineral Water Bottling Plant. With increasing population and modest annual increase of income, annual consumption of purified bottle water will also increase. In short, the current demand for purified bottled water will justify the establishment of about two bottling plants.', 
'Springs, wells, creeks, rivers where the plant is to be established. ',
 'The main stages of purification and bottling are pumping water from source to storage tanks, passing the water through a series of purification tanks, adding some chemicals at certain stages to further purify the water and bottling the water. Main machinery include water pumps with accessories, storage tanks, purification tanks, and bottling machine. ',
 'Economic utilization of a natural resource, promotion of self-sufficiency, introduction of new skills and technology, saving of regional financial resources. ',1,1),
(' Soft Drinks Bottling Plant','A soft drink is a type of man-made drink mainly composed of water (87%), sugar (12%), citric acid, color/essence, and sodium, benzonite.  A bottling plant is a plant which mixes and bottles the above ingredients in a factory set-up.  Non-alcoholic drinks or beverages like Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, Fanta, etc are some examples of soft drinks. ',
 'There are two old and small soft drinks bottling plants in the Amhara Region- in Dessie and in Gondar.  These plants are not only old but they produce only Pepsi products which limits the choice of consumers.  Besides, their production capacity is small and does not satisfy the demand for soft drinks in the Region.  Considering the volume of soft drinks which the Region imports from Addis Ababa, it can be concluded that there is a need to establish one soft drink bottling plant in Bahir Dar. ', 
'Annual production of soft drinks in the country is about 300 million bottles of which only 16 million bottles are the production of the Amhara Region.  Annual consumption of soft drinks in the Region is about 80 million bottles which is 5 times the production capacity of the two soft drinks plants located in the Region.  Regional deficit of soft drinks supply is compensated by supply from Addis Ababa.  The current demand of soft drinks of the Region which is satisfied through imports can absorb the production of a new bottling plant and this will replace imports of the products from outside the Region.', 
'The two major raw materials- water and sugar will be obtained from domestic sources while others such as essence will be imported.  If possible, the new plant should be affiliated with the two giant multi-nationals Coca Cola or Pepsi Cola. ', 'The main processing stages are washing of bottles, premixing with concentrate, mixing of the sugar and syrup, carbonation of the mix, filling, cap fitting, inspection, and packing.  Main machinery includes, automatic bottle washer, automatic filling machine, blending and carbonating unit, syrup concentrate mixing unit, water treatment plant, carbon dioxide supply equipment, cap fixing machine, etc. ',

(' Wine Production',' Wine is an alcoholic beverage product made from grapes which grow in Mediterranean type of climate. The product is consumed by people of different age groups, income and social classes. Though at an early stage, there is a new culture developing in large urban areas where people drink wine during meal times and in the evenings. There is growing medical evidence that drinking wine moderately is good from normal blood circulation and for regular hear beat.',
' ',
 'The supply of wine to the national market is composed of domestic production and imports. Some quantities of wine are also exported. Domestic production of wine is concentrated in and around Addis Ababa. The Amhara Region imports all its wine consumption from Addis Ababa and from abroad. Endowed with different types of soil and climate, the region has the potential of growing grapes from which wine is made of. The region has the potential not only to be self-sufficient in wine production for regional consumption but also for export. ',
 'For the first few years, grapes will be imported and then much of the grapes will be produced in local farms. ', 
' Like many other beverage products with alcohol content the main process of producing wine includes preparing the raw material by making it undergo different processes, fermentation addition of sugar and other additives, purifying or clearing the final product and bottling. There are a series of machines and tanks needed for producing wine.',

('Acid Slurry Making Plant', 
' Acid slurry also known as Dodecyl Benzene Sulphoric Acid is extensively used for the manufacture of detergent powder and washing soap.  It is prepared by sulphonation of dodecylx benzene with sulphuric acid.',
 ' All the washing soap and detergent powder consumed in the Amhara Region are imported from Addis Ababa and from abroad.  With 19 million people living in the Region, the consumption of the above products is relatively large; and this will increase with population growth and improvement of income.  Acid slurry being the basic input for producing detergent powder and washing soap should be produced in the Region to start production of the two items.', 
'The supply of soaps and detergents in the country is composed of domestic production and imports.  Domestic production of soaps and detergents between 2000 and 2004 was about 15,600 tons per year.  All the domestic production of soaps is concentrated in and around Addis Ababa.  The rest of the country is dependent on Addis Ababa.  In terms of consumption, the share of the Amhara Region from domestic production was about 3120 tons.  During the last 10 years, following the trade liberalization policy of the country, imports of soaps and detergents have been increasing every year.  Though specific figures are not available for the time being, a look at the market for soaps and detergents indicates that imported soaps and detergents are much larger in quantity than locally produced soaps and detergents.  With 26 percent of the county’s population, the Amhara Region can absorb the production of soaps and detergents by a medium size plant.  The acid slurry project will supply the basic inputs for soap factories in the Region and also for other similar factories in other parts of the country. ',
 ' The main inputs for the plant will be dodecyl benzene and sulphuric acid.  The sulphuric acid will be obtained from domestic sources while the dodecyel benzene will be imported.', ' There are two processes for the manufacture of acid slurry-continuous and batch.  For small scale plants, the batch process is more appropriate and it is more economical.  As mentioned earlier, the two inputs required are dodecyl benzene and sulphuric acid.  Dodecyl benzene is made from benzene and a propylene polymer.  For sulphonation of 100 parts of dodecyl benzene, 80 parts of sulphuric acid are required.  100 parts of dodcyl benzene is charged into a stainless steel reactor equipped with an agitator which is used to mix dodecyle benzene and sulphuric acid.  Dodecyle benzene is heated to about 450C and sulphuric acid is added slowly in such a way that the temperature of reactor should not exceed 500-550C.  As soon as sulphuric acid (H2SO4) is started to be added, cold water should pass through a jacket.  Mixing takes about 2-3 hours.  After completion of reaction, mass is taken to the settling tank made of lead lined with mild steel.  26.5 parts of ground ice is poured into this settling tank, then spent acid and dodeyle benzene sulphonic acid or acid slurry are separated. 
Main machinery needed include dodecy benzene dozing tank, made of mild steel, sulphuric acid and oleum dozing mild steel tank, reactor (s.s) separator (M.S) lead lined, air compressor, storage tank for D.D.B (M.S.) storage tanks for acids (M.S.), spent acid storage tanks (M.S) lead lined transfer pumps, pipes, valves and fittings',

('Activated Carbon Making Plant ',
 'Activated carbon is used for adoption of gases and vapors, and for purification and decolonization of several products of chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. The product is manufactured in granular and powdered forms. The powdered form is used for purification and decolorization purposes. This project idea considers the production of powdered activated carbon which can be used in the sugar, vegetable oil, alcoholic, beverages, etc. factories in our country. ', 
' ',
'The major end users of activated carbon are the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. The demand for powdered activated carbon is closely related to the need for purification and dicolorization of several industrial products. So far all the requirements of activated carbon in the country are met through imports. Between 1984 and 1993, average annual import of activated carbon who about 82 tons. However, annual imports of the product vary considerably. In 1985 import was 336 tons and in 1987 it was only 3 tons. Based on the average annual import, and expected growth rate of the manufacturing sector. (12.5), the demand for activated carbon was projected to be about 540 tons by the year 1013. ', 
' the raw material for the production of activated carbon is charcoal. Sawdust, lignite and other carbonaceous materials can also be used as raw materials. Lignite is available in North Gonder, North Wollo and North Shewa of the Amhara Region.',
 'The raw material charcoal or lignite should be crushed to the desired size and exposed to high temperature, 800-9000c. It will be allowed to cool and screened to separate extraneous materials associated with the raw material, and then the grading process, according to wize will be carried out. After the combustion process is completed, the product will be grounded to powdered carbon, and then washed to produce washed activated carbon and dried. Finally the finished Product will be packed in plastic bags. About 19 units of machinery and equipment are needed for the production of powdered activated carbon. The main ones are silos for charcoal or lignite charge, conveyors/elevators, crusher, feed hoppers with feeding system, rotary kiln for  activation, cooler for activated product, screening machine, grinding machine, acid pumps, slurry pumps, centrifuge, blenders/misers, etc. ',

('Animal Glue Making Plant ', 'Glue can be obtained either from plant or animal sources.  Glues obtained from boiling animal hides or bones are called animal glues.  Animal glue is insoluble in cold water but absorbs 6 to 8 times its weight of water at temperatures below its congealing point.  Glues are mainly used as adhesive materials whereas gelatin is valued mainly according to its stiffing jelly and emulsifying properties.  It is also used as one ingredient for colloidals, in sizing and coating. ', 'One of the main inputs for producing glue is animal bone.  This input can be obtained from abbiatores, meat processing factories and from other traditional sources where livestock are killed for consumption.  The natural death of cattle is also a source of animal bone.  With all these sources, however, no attempt has been made to produce glue on a commercial scale.  One exception is the unit within the Addis Ababa Abbiatores which produces a modest quantity of glue for domestic consumption.  The supply of animal bones outside Addis Ababa is not used for any economic purpose; it is simply thrown away.  Since animal glue is used by many types of industries such as shoe making, wood working, packaging, etc, the product has market as well as raw material. ' , 'The number of industries which use animal glue is increasing.  The leather shoes industry alone consumes a large quantity of animal glue every year.  So is the wood working industry.  Practically all the animal glue requirement of the country is met by imports.  Even in the absence of quantified figure as to the amount of animal glue consumed in the country annually, one could safely assume that there is a market for the product which can sustain the viability of a small animal glue making plant.  This plant can be established in the Amhara Region which contains more than 28 percent of the livestock resources of the country.

Crushed bones are first treated with lime to dissolve and remove unwanted materials.  Lime reduces the bulk of the fat inactive by saponification.  After the liming process, the alkali and other chemicals are completely removed by washing with pure water.  Sometimes weak acid is added to neutralize the lime and reduce the washing period.  For boiling the mass of the glue, if steam is not available, double jacketed pans which utilize cheap minerals oil or caster oil can serve the purpose.  Glue solution is now steam evaporated by using multiple effect evaporators under vacuum and low temperature.

"Mother liquor (consisting of residual oxalic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid and catalyst) of previous batch is taken into reactor". To this sulphuric acid is added which increases the temperature of reactor. The increased temperature is brought down with chilled water circulation through the cooling coils. Then nitric acid is added into the reactor. After this, sugar is added very slowly to avoid rapid increase in temperature and the rate of adding sugar increases gradually. Oxides of nitric acid generated during reaction are absorbed in a series of three absorbers using counter current principle. Oxalic acid obtained after centrifuging is then further purified by recrystallization using water a solvent. Then recrystalized material is again centrifuged and dried. Basic equipment required include storage tanks, mother liquor tanks, pumps, feed vessels, reactors, absorption columns, centrifuges, dissolving tanks, crystallizers.  ',

Between 1999/2000 and 2003/2004, average annual production of candles was about 610 tons is equivalent to to 12.2 million of candles.  The share of the Amhara Region in the consumption of candles was about 165 tons which is equivalent to 3.3 pieces of candle.  If this was the average level of consumption of candles in the Amhara Region during the period mentioned above, the current consumption could have grown at least to reflect population growth.  This consumption level could justify the establishment of candle manufacturing plant in the Region. ', ' Paraffin wax from which candle is made is a product of the petroleum industry.  As all petroleum products are imported, paraffin wax will also be imported. ', ' Major production stages include melting of the paraffin wax, putting the molten wax into moulds, calling the wax in the moulds, trimming the candles and packing.  Major machines required are vessels for melting wax, monldling machines, oil fired or electric furnace, spare moulds, pistons and accessories.

(' Veterinary Medicine Production Plant ', 'There are many types of medicines used for livestock. In the Ethiopian context, the most commonly used medicines are albendazone, besenil, flukazol, strepto penicillin and to ', ' In 2001 the livestock population of the country was estimated to be about 76 million of which 41 million (53 percent) were cattle. All the veterinary medicine requirements of the country, with some exceptions, are imported. Having the largest livestock population in Africa, one could have expected that the country has at least one veterinary medicine producing plant. But this is not the case. Probably one reason for having problems in the quality of our livestock a resource is the lack of dependable domestic supply of essential medicines for out livestock. The Amhara Region has over 28 percent of the livestock resources of the country. If we want to maximize the economic benefits of these resources, we should provide adequate feed, medicine and other modern animal husbandry practices to our livestock resources. In this case the Amhara Region alone needs one small size plant which formulates and produces essential veterinary medicines. The plant could also supply such medicines to other neighboring regions and countries.', ' An average import of veterinary medicines between 1984 and 1994 was 4185 tons. Of this average import figure, the above essential medicines constitute about one percent. This means about 41.85 tons of these medicines was the average import volume between 1984 and 1994. Projected demand for these medicines in 2006 is more than 66 tons. Medicines are taken in milligrams and grams dosages. Hence 66 tons or 660 quintals or 66,000 kgs is a large quantity for a medicine producing plant. We all know that veterinary services with full supply of required medicines has not covered all parts of the country and the medicine needs of all domestic animals are not met adequately. Had veterinary services been expanded to cover all rural areas, the consumption and projected demand for veterinary medicines would have been much larger than the figures indicated above In other words, the projected demand is underestimated.', ' all the raw materials or the ingredients will be imported.', ' The major operations of the plant are tablet making, syrup making and filling of capsules. The manufacturing of tablets consists of formulation, mixing and milling granulation, drying, lubrication, compression and coating. The syrup making consists of making consists of mixing the various ingredients in a jacketed kettle. The bottles to be used must be separated, washed, sterilized, dried and lab led. The modern die capsule machine is a self contained unit capable of continuously and automatically producing finished capsules from a supply of gelatin mass and filling material. There are about 17 pieces or sets of machinery and equipment to be used for the tables, capsule and injection liquid sections of the plant.', ' Saves foreign exchanges, improves the quality of livestock resource and increases their number, increases income of farmers who raise livestock, stimulates the meat hides and skins, and leather industries, and introduces new skills and technology.',  '2 ', '1 ');
