(' Coffee Processing :Roasting, Grinding & Packing',' Coffee beans are sold to the consumer either as “raw” beans or roasted, ground (made to powder) and packed. Usually roasted coffee is sold to hotels, coffee shops, restaurants, pastries, etc. and “raw” coffee beans are sold to households where the roasting aspect of coffee making is as important as the coffee drinking itself. This project idea is to establish coffee roasting … enterprises in the Amhara region where roasting of coffee on commercial scale is virtually unknown. ' ,
' ',
'The main consumers of roasted coffee are restaurants, hotels, coffee and tea shops, etc. While there are hundred of coffee roasting, grinding and packing enterprises in Addis Ababa and in areas south of Addis Ababa, there are no such enterprises in the Amhara region. Like the “raw” coffee, the Amhara Region also imports roasted coffee from other regions of the country. With 2.1 million people living in the urban areas of the Region, the consumption of processed coffee (roasted and ground) is substantial. It is understandable why the Region imports the “green” coffee beans, but it does not give economic sense to import the processed coffee while it is possible to do the processing in the region. The present consumption of processed coffee in the urban centers of the Amhara Region is estimated to be about 4015 tons, and this consumption level will grow with further urbanization and increased population. ' ,
'The principal raw materials are coffee beans; and the beans will be imported from other parts of the country. Until the Region becomes self – sufficient in coffee production. ',
'Major processing stages include cleaning of the beans, grading, roasting grinding and packaging. Major machinery units will include cleaning machine, roasting, grinding and packing machines. ',
' More value added, promotes self sufficiency, saves financial resources',1,1),
(' Molasses Based Alcohol Production Plant',' Industrial alcohol is an important input in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and veterinary spirits, perfumes and alcoholic beverages. One major “raw material” for producing alcohol is molasses which is a by product of sugar factories. ', 
' ',
' Alcohol is in demand in pharmaceuticals, veterinary services, health care institutions such is health centers, clinics and hospitals, perfume producing factories, liquor producing beverage factories. Alcohol is also needed in households for emergency purposes, in barber shops and beauty salons. Many developing countries meet their alcohol requirements from imports. Molasses from which alcohol is produced is a by product of the country’s sugar factories. Domestic production of alcohol between 2000 and 2004 was on the average 14,400 hectoliters per year. On the other hand, average annual production of molasses during the same period was 50,300 tons; Molasses is used for alcohol production and as an ingredient in animal feed. Some portion of the product is exported. For a long time there has been a surplus in the production of molasses and the surplus product is dumped into streams or is used to maintain roads within the factory and plantation sites of the sugar factories.
All alcoholic beverages produced in the country are manufactured in and around Addis Ababa. These beverages are put in glass bottles and are distributed to all parts of the country near or far. The Amhara Region which is on the average about 500 km from Addis Ababa receives its share of alcoholic beverages from Addis Ababa. As the beverages are packed in glass bottles they are heavy, cumbersome and expensive to transport long distances. Between 2000 and 2004, the liquor consumption share of the Amhara Region was about 10,000 hecto liters per year on the average. Beverage products which use bottles for packaging are located near major consumer centers to avoid excessive transportation costs.
Currently, it is estimated that more than 20 thousand hector liter of ethyl alcohol per annum  is used in Ethiopia. Here, this figure is taken as a base for the future demand projection. And, in line with the economic growth, it is also assumed that for the coming ten years the annual utilization of ethanol will increase at 10 % per annum. Based on these assumptions, the future demand for ethyl alcohol is projected as follows.
These products are produced in different consumer centers and distributed regional or local markets. The liquor market in the Amhara region can justify the establishment of a liquor factory in the region. This factory will require alcohol as one of the major inputs. To supply the liquor factory with the required amount of alcohol, a factory that will refine molasses to produce alcohol will be needed. The raw material- molasses will be transported in big containers to the factory site to be used as input for the alcohol factory. The remaining part of the molasses will be used to produce animal feed which is in short supply in the region. Molasses for the alcohol factory will be transported from the existing factories until such a time that the Amhara Region establishes its own factory. The alcohol to be produced will not only used to make liquor; it will also be used for other purposes in health care institutions, barber shops, beauty salons, etc. ', 
'The main raw materials are molasses, sulphuric acid and nutritive salts (ammonia phosphate). For every 100 liters of alcohol distilled about 1.5 kgs of sulphuric acid and 0.35kg. of nutritive salts are required. The acids will be imported and the molasses will be obtained from domestic sources.',
 'The process of alcohol production is based on the fermentation of molasses and extracting the alcohol there from by using column distilleries. The molasses is diluted with water and allowed to ferment. From the fermented molasses, the alcohol is finally extracted. The required equipment and facilities include equipment for receiving and diluting molasses, pre-fermentation and fermentation equipment, distillation equipment, storage tanks, steam boiler and electric generating nit, laboratory equipment, truck mounted tanker for transporting the molasses.

(' Processing or Fruit-Based Drinks',' There are a number of fruit types from which drinks or juices can be made. The common fruits from which fruit drinks or juices are made are organizes, grapes, pineapples, mangoes, papayas and other fruits of the citrus family. The juices or drinks are consumed usually during breakfast time or in refreshment hours. Processed fruits and drinks are normally packed in cans, bottles, plastic pouches or even in cartons.', 
' ',
'Currently, there are three main sources for the supply of fruit-based drinks and juices in the country. The largest supply comes from households, snack shops, pastries, coffee shops, restaurants, hotels and “juice houses”. It is almost impossible to estimate the volume of supply from scattered sources. The other domestic source is Merti Fruits Processing Plant located in the Awash Valley. This plant has produced an average of about 1300 tons of fruit drinks per year between 1986 and 1995; and during this period production by the plant had grown by 1.5 percent per year. The third source of supply is import. During the last 15 years, because of related foreign exchange control, imports of fruits drinks and juices have been growing fast. Now all the so-called super-markets and even small and large grocery stores are filled with imported fruit drinks and juices. In fact, this has negative impact on domestic production. Some newly established “milk Processing” enterprises supply what they call “fruit juices” to the market. (How a milk, processing plant can produce fruit juice is not clear.) The main determining factors for the demand of fruit juices and drinks are income and population size especially urban population. Admittedly, consumption of fruit juices and drinks in the Amhara Region is confined to a small section of the urban population. If we assume only 20 percent of the 400,000 urban families in the Region consume fruit juices and drinks regularly, the size of consumers in the Region is about 80,000. if we assume that a family of five consumes at least two liters of fruit juice or drink every day, the annual consumption of these products in the Region is 58,400 tons = (80,000X2 lit. X 365/100Kgs; 1000 lits.=1000Kgs.). One can feel this is optimistic estimate. To be on the safe side, let us say the estimated demand is one-half of the above estimate. This leaves us with a potential demand of 26000 tons per year. This can justify the establishment of medium size fruit-based drinks and juices producing plant. (project ideas have proposed the establishment of citrus fruits plantations in the Region.) ',
 ' Citrus fruits plantations in the Region and outside the Region.',
 'It is assumed that orange juices and drinks will be the main products of the plant. The Process of producing these products require cleaning of the raw material (organs), warming the fruits peeling, juice extracting, pre-heating and cooling, centrifugalization, deaeration, seasoning, sterilization, filling, cooling, labeling and packing.The main plant and machinery required are, receiving line and bins, inspection, washing and sizing, juice, extractors, finishers, pasteurizer, filler and sealer, cooling machine, labeler, centrifuge, evaporator, vessels with pumps, boiler, conveying unit, laboratory, concentrate production machinery and equipment.

' Saves foreign exchange and regional financial resources, stimulates regional production of citrus fruits promotes self-sufficiency in food production',1,1),
(' Production of Malt for Breweries',' Malt is the major input to produce beer.  It is what is known in Amharic as “bikil”.  The raw material from which malt is made is malt barley which can be grown in many localities of the Region.  Basically, malt is prepared by soaking barley in water for a period for germination, drying it and making it into flour before it is used as an ingredient to make bear or whisky. ', 
'There are two large breweries in the Amhara Region (Dashen and Bati) established in the last 10 years.  These breweries either obtain their malt requirement from the Asella Malt Factory or they import it from abroad.  Most likely they import the malt.  This requires foreign exchange which has always been in short supply in our country.  The type of barley needed for malt production is being grown in Arsie and Bale.  This barley can be grown in the highland areas of the Amhara Region.  Hence it is possible to produce malt in the Region. ', 
' Domestic production of malt between 1999/200 and 2003/2004 was on the average 13,650 tons per year.  This production volume is perhaps one-half of the malt requirements of the existing breweries.  Subject to detail market study, the existing deficit in the supply for malt is estimated to be between 5000 to 8000 tons.  The proposed malt producing plant is to fill this supply gap and to make the Region self-sufficient in the production of malt.', 
' The raw material which is malt barley could be obtained from the high-land parts of the Region provided that malt barley seeds are distributed to farmers so that they grow the barley.', 
'Malt barely is fed into grading machines to obtain uniform malting parameters;  germination is carried out in “germinating boxes”, adding water from time to time to keep the product moisture constant.  The germinating process normally lasts five to six days; kilning process takes place; after clearing, the malt is stored in silos.  Main production machinery include barley intake and pre-cleaning, barley main cleaning and grading, germinating boxes, kiln conveyors, cooling plant, silos, etc. ','Saving in foreign exchange and regional financial resources, stimulating the farming sector of the Region, introduction of new skills and technology, self-sufficiency in this particular product.

(' Purified Water Bottling Plant',' Purified water has become popular among foreigners and high-income groups during the last 5 to 7 years. Now there are more than five purified water bottling plants in the country clustering in and around Addis Ababa. The product has in some areas become a conspicuous consumption item. ',
 ' When factory bottled purified water appeared in the market for the first time, many people doubted about the market success of the product because they believed that with low per capita income, not very many people will buy the product. But because of robust demand not only there is one bottling plant but more than 5 in a matter of six years. However, like many other factories, bottling plants of purified water are concentrated around Addis Ababa. Bottled water is one of those products which is expensive to transport long distances. Because purified water can be processed from springs, rivers, wells, etc., the bottling plant could be established any place where there are these water sources. So far, except for one or two bottling plants in North Shewa, there are no new purified water bottling plants in the Amhara Region. Consumers in the Region get their plastic bottled purified water from Addis Ababa which makes the price of the water almost twice that of Addis Ababa. The Region should be self-sufficient in the supply of purified water that people consume; and one or two bottling plants should be established in the region.',
 ' The main consumers of bottled purified water in the Amhara Region are the urban high-income groups and outsides who travel through the Region, such as tourists, businesspeople and civil servants. If we assume that at least five percent of the urban population (95,000) of the Region consumes one bottle of purified water per day, this amounts to an annual consumption of 35 million bottles which is more than one half of the production capacity of the Ambo Mineral Water Bottling Plant. With increasing population and modest annual increase of income, annual consumption of purified bottle water will also increase. In short, the current demand for purified bottled water will justify the establishment of about two bottling plants.', 
'Springs, wells, creeks, rivers where the plant is to be established. ',
 'The main stages of purification and bottling are pumping water from source to storage tanks, passing the water through a series of purification tanks, adding some chemicals at certain stages to further purify the water and bottling the water. Main machinery include water pumps with accessories, storage tanks, purification tanks, and bottling machine. ',
 'Economic utilization of a natural resource, promotion of self-sufficiency, introduction of new skills and technology, saving of regional financial resources. ',1,1),
(' Soft Drinks Bottling Plant','A soft drink is a type of man-made drink mainly composed of water (87%), sugar (12%), citric acid, color/essence, and sodium, benzonite.  A bottling plant is a plant which mixes and bottles the above ingredients in a factory set-up.  Non-alcoholic drinks or beverages like Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, Fanta, etc are some examples of soft drinks. ',
 'There are two old and small soft drinks bottling plants in the Amhara Region- in Dessie and in Gondar.  These plants are not only old but they produce only Pepsi products which limits the choice of consumers.  Besides, their production capacity is small and does not satisfy the demand for soft drinks in the Region.  Considering the volume of soft drinks which the Region imports from Addis Ababa, it can be concluded that there is a need to establish one soft drink bottling plant in Bahir Dar. ', 
'Annual production of soft drinks in the country is about 300 million bottles of which only 16 million bottles are the production of the Amhara Region.  Annual consumption of soft drinks in the Region is about 80 million bottles which is 5 times the production capacity of the two soft drinks plants located in the Region.  Regional deficit of soft drinks supply is compensated by supply from Addis Ababa.  The current demand of soft drinks of the Region which is satisfied through imports can absorb the production of a new bottling plant and this will replace imports of the products from outside the Region.', 
'The two major raw materials- water and sugar will be obtained from domestic sources while others such as essence will be imported.  If possible, the new plant should be affiliated with the two giant multi-nationals Coca Cola or Pepsi Cola. ', 'The main processing stages are washing of bottles, premixing with concentrate, mixing of the sugar and syrup, carbonation of the mix, filling, cap fitting, inspection, and packing.  Main machinery includes, automatic bottle washer, automatic filling machine, blending and carbonating unit, syrup concentrate mixing unit, water treatment plant, carbon dioxide supply equipment, cap fixing machine, etc. ',

(' Wine Production',' Wine is an alcoholic beverage product made from grapes which grow in Mediterranean type of climate. The product is consumed by people of different age groups, income and social classes. Though at an early stage, there is a new culture developing in large urban areas where people drink wine during meal times and in the evenings. There is growing medical evidence that drinking wine moderately is good from normal blood circulation and for regular hear beat.',
' ',
 'The supply of wine to the national market is composed of domestic production and imports. Some quantities of wine are also exported. Domestic production of wine is concentrated in and around Addis Ababa. The Amhara Region imports all its wine consumption from Addis Ababa and from abroad. Endowed with different types of soil and climate, the region has the potential of growing grapes from which wine is made of. The region has the potential not only to be self-sufficient in wine production for regional consumption but also for export. ',
 'For the first few years, grapes will be imported and then much of the grapes will be produced in local farms. ', 
' Like many other beverage products with alcohol content the main process of producing wine includes preparing the raw material by making it undergo different processes, fermentation addition of sugar and other additives, purifying or clearing the final product and bottling. There are a series of machines and tanks needed for producing wine.',

('Acid Slurry Making Plant', 
' Acid slurry also known as Dodecyl Benzene Sulphoric Acid is extensively used for the manufacture of detergent powder and washing soap.  It is prepared by sulphonation of dodecylx benzene with sulphuric acid.',
 ' All the washing soap and detergent powder consumed in the Amhara Region are imported from Addis Ababa and from abroad.  With 19 million people living in the Region, the consumption of the above products is relatively large; and this will increase with population growth and improvement of income.  Acid slurry being the basic input for producing detergent powder and washing soap should be produced in the Region to start production of the two items.', 
'The supply of soaps and detergents in the country is composed of domestic production and imports.  Domestic production of soaps and detergents between 2000 and 2004 was about 15,600 tons per year.  All the domestic production of soaps is concentrated in and around Addis Ababa.  The rest of the country is dependent on Addis Ababa.  In terms of consumption, the share of the Amhara Region from domestic production was about 3120 tons.  During the last 10 years, following the trade liberalization policy of the country, imports of soaps and detergents have been increasing every year.  Though specific figures are not available for the time being, a look at the market for soaps and detergents indicates that imported soaps and detergents are much larger in quantity than locally produced soaps and detergents.  With 26 percent of the county’s population, the Amhara Region can absorb the production of soaps and detergents by a medium size plant.  The acid slurry project will supply the basic inputs for soap factories in the Region and also for other similar factories in other parts of the country. ',
 ' The main inputs for the plant will be dodecyl benzene and sulphuric acid.  The sulphuric acid will be obtained from domestic sources while the dodecyel benzene will be imported.', ' There are two processes for the manufacture of acid slurry-continuous and batch.  For small scale plants, the batch process is more appropriate and it is more economical.  As mentioned earlier, the two inputs required are dodecyl benzene and sulphuric acid.  Dodecyl benzene is made from benzene and a propylene polymer.  For sulphonation of 100 parts of dodecyl benzene, 80 parts of sulphuric acid are required.  100 parts of dodcyl benzene is charged into a stainless steel reactor equipped with an agitator which is used to mix dodecyle benzene and sulphuric acid.  Dodecyle benzene is heated to about 450C and sulphuric acid is added slowly in such a way that the temperature of reactor should not exceed 500-550C.  As soon as sulphuric acid (H2SO4) is started to be added, cold water should pass through a jacket.  Mixing takes about 2-3 hours.  After completion of reaction, mass is taken to the settling tank made of lead lined with mild steel.  26.5 parts of ground ice is poured into this settling tank, then spent acid and dodeyle benzene sulphonic acid or acid slurry are separated. 
Main machinery needed include dodecy benzene dozing tank, made of mild steel, sulphuric acid and oleum dozing mild steel tank, reactor (s.s) separator (M.S) lead lined, air compressor, storage tank for D.D.B (M.S.) storage tanks for acids (M.S.), spent acid storage tanks (M.S) lead lined transfer pumps, pipes, valves and fittings',

('Activated Carbon Making Plant ',
 'Activated carbon is used for adoption of gases and vapors, and for purification and decolonization of several products of chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. The product is manufactured in granular and powdered forms. The powdered form is used for purification and decolorization purposes. This project idea considers the production of powdered activated carbon which can be used in the sugar, vegetable oil, alcoholic, beverages, etc. factories in our country. ', 
' ',
'The major end users of activated carbon are the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. The demand for powdered activated carbon is closely related to the need for purification and dicolorization of several industrial products. So far all the requirements of activated carbon in the country are met through imports. Between 1984 and 1993, average annual import of activated carbon who about 82 tons. However, annual imports of the product vary considerably. In 1985 import was 336 tons and in 1987 it was only 3 tons. Based on the average annual import, and expected growth rate of the manufacturing sector. (12.5), the demand for activated carbon was projected to be about 540 tons by the year 1013. ', 
' the raw material for the production of activated carbon is charcoal. Sawdust, lignite and other carbonaceous materials can also be used as raw materials. Lignite is available in North Gonder, North Wollo and North Shewa of the Amhara Region.',
 'The raw material charcoal or lignite should be crushed to the desired size and exposed to high temperature, 800-9000c. It will be allowed to cool and screened to separate extraneous materials associated with the raw material, and then the grading process, according to wize will be carried out. After the combustion process is completed, the product will be grounded to powdered carbon, and then washed to produce washed activated carbon and dried. Finally the finished Product will be packed in plastic bags. About 19 units of machinery and equipment are needed for the production of powdered activated carbon. The main ones are silos for charcoal or lignite charge, conveyors/elevators, crusher, feed hoppers with feeding system, rotary kiln for  activation, cooler for activated product, screening machine, grinding machine, acid pumps, slurry pumps, centrifuge, blenders/misers, etc. ',

('Animal Glue Making Plant ', 'Glue can be obtained either from plant or animal sources.  Glues obtained from boiling animal hides or bones are called animal glues.  Animal glue is insoluble in cold water but absorbs 6 to 8 times its weight of water at temperatures below its congealing point.  Glues are mainly used as adhesive materials whereas gelatin is valued mainly according to its stiffing jelly and emulsifying properties.  It is also used as one ingredient for colloidals, in sizing and coating. ', 'One of the main inputs for producing glue is animal bone.  This input can be obtained from abbiatores, meat processing factories and from other traditional sources where livestock are killed for consumption.  The natural death of cattle is also a source of animal bone.  With all these sources, however, no attempt has been made to produce glue on a commercial scale.  One exception is the unit within the Addis Ababa Abbiatores which produces a modest quantity of glue for domestic consumption.  The supply of animal bones outside Addis Ababa is not used for any economic purpose; it is simply thrown away.  Since animal glue is used by many types of industries such as shoe making, wood working, packaging, etc, the product has market as well as raw material. ' , 'The number of industries which use animal glue is increasing.  The leather shoes industry alone consumes a large quantity of animal glue every year.  So is the wood working industry.  Practically all the animal glue requirement of the country is met by imports.  Even in the absence of quantified figure as to the amount of animal glue consumed in the country annually, one could safely assume that there is a market for the product which can sustain the viability of a small animal glue making plant.  This plant can be established in the Amhara Region which contains more than 28 percent of the livestock resources of the country.

Crushed bones are first treated with lime to dissolve and remove unwanted materials.  Lime reduces the bulk of the fat inactive by saponification.  After the liming process, the alkali and other chemicals are completely removed by washing with pure water.  Sometimes weak acid is added to neutralize the lime and reduce the washing period.  For boiling the mass of the glue, if steam is not available, double jacketed pans which utilize cheap minerals oil or caster oil can serve the purpose.  Glue solution is now steam evaporated by using multiple effect evaporators under vacuum and low temperature.

"Mother liquor (consisting of residual oxalic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid and catalyst) of previous batch is taken into reactor". To this sulphuric acid is added which increases the temperature of reactor. The increased temperature is brought down with chilled water circulation through the cooling coils. Then nitric acid is added into the reactor. After this, sugar is added very slowly to avoid rapid increase in temperature and the rate of adding sugar increases gradually. Oxides of nitric acid generated during reaction are absorbed in a series of three absorbers using counter current principle. Oxalic acid obtained after centrifuging is then further purified by recrystallization using water a solvent. Then recrystalized material is again centrifuged and dried. Basic equipment required include storage tanks, mother liquor tanks, pumps, feed vessels, reactors, absorption columns, centrifuges, dissolving tanks, crystallizers.  ',

All the veterinary medicine requirements of the country, with some exceptions, are imported. Having the largest livestock population in Africa, one could have expected that the country has at least one veterinary medicine producing plant. But this is not the case. Probably one reason for having problems in the quality of our livestock a resource is the lack of dependable domestic supply of essential medicines for out livestock. The Amhara Region has over 28 percent of the livestock resources of the country. If we want to maximize the economic benefits of these resources, we should provide adequate feed, medicine and other modern animal husbandry practices to our livestock resources. In this case the Amhara Region alone needs one small size plant which formulates and produces essential veterinary medicines. The plant could also supply such medicines to other neighboring regions and countries.', ' An average import of veterinary medicines between 1984 and 1994 was 4185 tons. Of this average import figure, the above essential medicines constitute about one percent. This means about 41.85 tons of these medicines was the average import volume between 1984 and 1994. Projected demand for these medicines in 2006 is more than 66 tons. Medicines are taken in milligrams and grams dosages. Hence 66 tons or 660 quintals or 66,000 kgs is a large quantity for a medicine producing plant. We all know that veterinary services with full supply of required medicines has not covered all parts of the country and the medicine needs of all domestic animals are not met adequately. Had veterinary services been expanded to cover all rural areas, the consumption and projected demand for veterinary medicines would have been much larger than the figures indicated above In other words, the projected demand is underestimated.', ' all the raw materials or the ingredients will be imported.', ' The major operations of the plant are tablet making, syrup making and filling of capsules. The manufacturing of tablets consists of formulation, mixing and milling granulation, drying, lubrication, compression and coating.

('Agricultural Mechanization Services ', 'The other familiar name of agricultural mechanization service is rental service of agricultural machinery, equipments, tools and technical advices. These services include the provision of modern agricultural machinery and equipment for ploughing, harvesting, processing, transporting and storing on rental basis and the acquisition of technical know-how through technical advices by paying fees for advisors. Services that are provided through agricultural mechanization are substitutes for mechanization of farms and other agricultural activities performed by owning the machinery and equipment. These types of services enable farmers to use modern farm machinery and equipment with out burdening each farmer or group of farmers in owning expensive farm machinery and equipment. Agricultural mechanization services reduce farming time and enable farmers to plow, harvest and store their farm produce in optimal periods of each season thereby increasing productivity and production volume. These agricultural machinery rental centers could also have middle level technical advisors who will consult farmers on the different activities of farming and livestock raising. The consultation will be done with the payment of reasonable fees. The main advantage of these rental centers to farmers is, they enable group of farmers with adjacent farms to rent (in group) agricultural machinery such as a tractor for plowing the adjacent farms as a unit. This will reduce the rental cost for each farmer and will also minimize the operation expenses of the farm mechanization service center.
  ', ' ','More than 3 million hectares of land in the Amhara Region is under cultivation. Under normal conditions, One tractor plows about 10 hectares per day. For one cycle of plowing, 300,000 tractor-days are needed to plow the 3 million hectares of farm lands of the Region. This is the highest potential demand for tractor services in the Region. But many farms in the Region are too steep and/or too rugged for using tractors for plowing. In addition many other farms are also filled with small and big boulders which make them unsuitable for tractor plowing. Given these unfavorable conditions, we can assume that about 40 percent of farms in the Region are suitable for tractor plowing. This means about 120,000 tractor-days are required to perform one cycle of plowing in the Region. This is the highest realistic potential demand for tractor rental services.  Let us get closer to the ground and see the potential zones of the Region which will use tractor services with the highest economic and financial benefits. The first candidates are most parts of East and West Gojjam and Awe zones, areas around Lake Tana in North and South Gondar Zones and West Gojjam, some valley plains in North and South Wollo zones, and the highland platen of North Shewa.

('Agro forestry Project ', 'Agro forestry is a farming system or land use system that integrates crop and /or livestock with trees and shrubs. The resulting biological interactions provide multiple benefits, including diversified income sources, increased biological production, and better water quality, improved habitat for both human and wildlife. Farmers adopt Agro forestry practices for two reasons. They want to increase their economic stability and want to improve the management of natural resources under their care. The components of agro forestry practices and the resultant benefits / product depend on specific agro ecological areas where the practices take place. An agro forestry system might produce firewood, biomass feed stock, fodder for grazing animals, producing mushrooms beekeeping etc together with crop production such as maize, wheat soybeans, haricot beans etc can be cited a examples of the component products. ', ' Natural resources in the Amhara Region have been subject t degradation for centuries; more seriously in the highland areas. The highland of the region, characterized b rugged and undulating terrain with easily erodible soils and low natural vegetation cover is highly exposed to land degradation.  Soils in the highlands of the region have lost their productive capacity. On the other hand population pressure in these areas has pushed farmers to fragile and hilly areas. Hence land degradation has become a serious threat to agricultural productivity; Soil erosion as a result of seasonal intense rainfall is decreasing soil depth, water holding capacity and fertility and increasing the frequency of drought in the marginal areas. Deforestation has taken place at an alarming rate. Fuel wood is a critical problem for most rural households; forcing them to use dung, weeds and crop residues. These have further worsened the soil fertility and organic matter base.
Erosion and runoff form overexploited and fragile areas are particularly critical in highland areas watersheds. Originate land mismanagement in the highlands has adverse effects on both and lowland agroecologicla systems. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an agro ecologically and socio economically sustainable and viable farming or land use. System; that is, agro forestry practice.', ' Agro forestry systems are much more complex than single purpose farm or forestry enterprises. Products from each component of the system will require specific markets. Therefore, selecting the components of ago forestry systems must be on the basis of careful marketing plan. The demand for fuel wood, house construction by the rural households and rural towns is a great potential to be considered. Demand for timber, log and pulpwood by local household manufacturing industries is also very high. For most of forestry products, the markets must be close to the site. Otherwise the transportation costs will eat up the potential profit.', ' Seedlings of various trees and shrubs species are the basic raw materials required which must be multiplied or raised b the regional bureau of agriculture. Fertilizers may be required in the early stages of the seed lines which are also available in the region.', ' Alley cropping involves growing crops (grains, forges, vegetables) between fruit trees, palm trees, or wood tree species planted in rows. The spacing between the rows is designed to accommodate the mature size of trees while leaving room for the planned alley crops. When sun-loving plants like corn, soybeans wheat or herbs will be alley cropped, the alleyways need to be wide enough to let in plenty of height even the trees have matured.
Another practice of agro forestry is called silvopature where tree and pasture crops and grown in combination. Hardwoods, nut trees and pines are planted in multiple rows, and livestock grazing between them. In early years of (trees) establishment, crops or hay are harvested from the planting. Grazing begins after two or three years, when the trees re large enough so that the livestock cannot damage them. Well-managed grazing will increase organic matter and improve soil conditions. Windbreaks or shelterbelts are also practices of agro forestry. Tree species (for various land use) and planted in multiple rows along the edge of a field to reduce wind effects on crops or livestock. In this practice wind and water erosions re reduced, crating  moist, more favorable microclimate for the crop this, beneficial insects find permanent habitat in windbreaks, benefit wildlife by providing shelters and safe movements. Windbreak or shelterbelts can also generate income by selective timber harvest, fruit harvest, firewood sales etc. Other practices of agro forestry may include home garden of fruit trees, inter planting firewood species on coop land, agriculture with honey producing trees, multipurpose trees on bunds or terraces for soil conservation etc. All these practices of agroforetry will establish sustainable agricultural production and the interaction of the components of agro forestry systems will increase production better than the single component practices.', 'Agro forestry practices established sustainable and environmental friendly production systems. The biological interaction of agro forestry components gives higher production or biomass per unit of area than any single component production system. This is because the system (agro forestry) improves soil fertility soil porosity, aeration, and controls soil erosion by providing ground cover, exploit more soil volume, and regulate microclimate. It also provides year long employment opportunity and diversified income. ', '3', '1'),
('Apple Production Farms ', 'Growing apple trees in the home garden or as agro foresting production system can be financially rewarding. There are several varieties of apple to be considered for selection before planting for successful apple production. The four major varieties which dominate the world production are red delicious, Golden delicious, Rome beauty and galas. Apple fruits are round in shape with juicy flesh and skin, green, red or yellow in color. An apple’s primary nutritional benefit is in the pectin and fiber. Apples contain as much as fiber as whole cereals. They also contain chemicals that play a role in prevention of certain cancers and heart diseases. ', ' Apples provide bulk in the diet for the proper functioning of the body’s digestive and regulatory systems. Pectin and hemicelluloses and the acid-base ratio contribute to this pectin and mild acids help fight body toxins, aid digestion and pep up the whole body system. Apples are rich in pectin. Pectin has been associated with helping to keep cholesterol levels in balance and in this connection it is felt to be significant in helping to reduce the incidence of certain types of heart diseases. The high potassium, low sodium ratio in apples is also important in certain cardiac and  renal problems as well as in diet for over weight persons. Some studies have indicated that persons eating apples regularly have fewer headaches and other illness associated with nervous tension. Other studies have also shown an association of regular apple consumption with a reduced incidence of colds and other upper respiratory sickness. Apple juice is also preferred for infant due to its mid nature and low acid content. In general, apples contain modest amount of nearly all of the most important nutrients. They have universally accepteel flavor, appeal, versatility and convenience for use. They can also be available through out the year due to their long shelf life. They are good for teeth, stomach, skin, nerves, smiles and good health.', 'Most apples produced in the world are packed and sold fresh, some are produced for the processing market for apple juice production. Apple production in Ethiopia in general and in the Amhara region in particular mainly will play an import substitution role. Most apple consumption of the country are satisfied through imports. Hence, domestic markets will be the main sales outlets for the Amhara Region’s apple production. In the long run as production grows international markets are still very significant due the potential of higher returns, but require higher quality. Red delicious and Rome beauty apples have the largest share in the world market. In recent years organic food production has been growing drastically on the world market. In this in the highlands of the Amhara Region can easily produce organic apple and get higher return per unit of land than producing grain crops.  ', ' Trellis material tape and twine, free training material, mulching material compost, fertilizer, chemicals, beehives for  cross pollination are required for the process of apple production which are available locally. The only material that is not locally available in sufficient quantity and quality is apple tree seedlings. Seedlings or good nursery sources should be identified from major apple producing countries eg. USA Europ, Asia etc. But pilot project could start with seedlings from Arba Minch. When buying apple trees (seedlings) they must be of recommended varieties from a reliable source. The seedlings must be 1 year old with vigorous root system. Small agricultural tools such spale, rakes, disks, auger, mower, sprayers etc are required. Roots on the loose soil making sure they are not twisted or crowded in the hole. As you cover the roots press and make firm the soil to be sure it surrounds the roots and to remove air pockets. Do not add fertilizer at planting time as the root can be burned. When you have finished planting the tree water well to eliminate air pockets and provide good contact between the roots and the soil. Apple trees requires pruning for better and faster production. Proper training and pruning of fruit trees is essential to the development of a strong tree framework that will support fruit production. Properly shaped trees will yield high quality fruit much sooner and will live significantly longer. Regular pruning and training will also maximize light penetration to the developing flower buds and fruits. Apple trees often set  a heavier crop of fruits than the branch (limbs) can withstand. To ensure good fruit size, to return bloom for the following year, and to prevent tree breakage, it is necessary to thin the fruit
Adequate tree nutrition is essential for quality apple production. To maintain the required level of nutrition status, follow the fertilization guidelines provided by the soil test. Controlling weeds and grasses around young apple trees minimizes competition for soil nutrients and moisture, en coverage vigorous tree growth and increases fruit size. Avoid mechanical weed cultivation. ', ' Apple tree growing can be rewarding for both small scale farmers as well as commercial growers. Several factors are important to be considered for a successful apple production. Apple variety and root stock, site selection, proper planting, training and pruning, adequate fertility, and pest control contribute to healthy and productive trees.
Well-drained, sandy loam with a PH below 6.5 is best.  Finer-textured-loamy clay soils will suffice if they are well drained. An elevated slope or hilltop is best to minimize frost damages. Good quality irrigation water should be available for moisture stress period. Fencing the site is advisable to protect from animal damage. Apple trees require full sun and big trees shade should be avoided.Land should be well prepared for planting the apple trees. One year old nursery trees with good root systems should be ready. To plant the apple trees, first dig a hole 60 cm deep and sufficiently wide for the diameter of the root system. Place some of the loose soil back in to the hole and loosen the soil on the wall of the planting hole so the roots can easily penetrate the soil. Spread the roots to protect shallow root damages. Good sanitation practices are necessary to control pest problems. Diseases and insects can cause serious damage to apple frees and fruits. A regular spray program is essential for high fruit quality and healthy trees. Apples reach maturity at different times, depending on variety and climate. When apple fruits’ skin color changes from green to yellow it indicates maturity and it will be crisp and juicy with pleasant taste if one takes a bite. Proper storage conditions help prolong the shelf-life apple. Depending on the conditions of storage, apples can be stored up to 12 months.', 'Apple production in the Amhara Region will save foreign exchange by substituting imported apples. Apples contain most important food nutrients and are good for health. Apple production is a labour intensive, hence will create employment opportunity throughout the year.

Ironically while bananas are produced in the tropics, per capita consumption of the fruit is much bigger in temperate lands than in tropical countries. The highest concentration of banana consumption is in western Europe and north America where the standard of living is much higher than in any other parts of the world. Bananas are one of the fruits believed to maintain good health for people who consume it regularly. its main nutrition contents are carbohydrates and proteins which are essential for good health.', ' ', 'With about 2.1 million people living in the urban centers of the Amhara Region, there is a potential of high consumption of bananas provided that the fruit is supplied to the market at affordable prices. If we assume that at least 30 percent of the urban residents of the Region can afford to consume 2 kgs of bananas per head per week, the annual consumption of the fruit will be 655,200 quintals or 6552 tons of bananas. This is about the most reasonable and realistic estimate given the low per capita income of the majority of the urban population. The Amhara Region covers an area of 170,000 sq. km. of land and has among the best suitable climate and soils for growing bananas. In fact before banana plantations were established in the Awash Valley in the 1950s and 1960s, there were many batches of banana orchards in many parts of the Amhara Region. Unfortunately these banana growing localities were not expanded to be large banana plantations. Consequently, almost all the bananas consumed in the Amhara region are transported from Awash Valley about 800 km away form Bahir Dar:- the major consumption center of the region. This increases the price of bananas in the region which makes the fruit out of the reach of the majority of potential consumers. With growing urban population and modest increases in per capita income, the demand for bananas and other fruits and vegetables will increase. For now there is sufficient demand for bananas in Bahir Dar, Gondar, Dessie and Combolcha to absorb the production of medium scale plantations to be established near the above major consumption centers.

Tens of thousands of sheep and goats are also exported to the gulf countries every year. Recently, Sudan with its newly fouled oil wealth has started importing large number of cattle, sheep and goats from the Amhara region. And this demand will grow in the future. The domestic market for sheep and goats is supplied by merchants who buy the animals from individual farmers and bring the animals to major urban center to sell. The traditional system of raising sheep and goat is characterized by the presence of large numbers of small scale farmers who practice stock rising as secondary activity next to farming. Each farmer may own a small flock of sheep or goats with five or six heads per flock; and a farmer may sell one goat or sheep in a year. This traditional system is extremely inefficient in terms of supplying good quality sheep and goat. The animals are not properly feed and cared for. Selective breeding and cross breeding are not practiced. As a result the quantity of mutton obtained from each sheep or goat is relatively small. The export market for sheep and goats is dominated by supply from the eastern parts of the country. The regional states of Afar and Somali are the main supplies of sheep and goats to the Arabian Gulf states.

('Cut Flower Production ', 'The wide range of agro ecological conditions of the Amhara region is suitable for floriculture production. High quality, long stem, and big budded rose flowers can be grown in the high land of Misrak Gojam, Awi, and Semen Gonder zones. Small budded and short stem rose flowers can also be grown in the lowland areas of Mirab Gojam zone (Bahir Dar Zuria and Merawi areas). In the category of cut rose flowers, there are several varieties of flowers with distinct shapes of petals, colors and known by different commercial names e.g. Aroma, Havanna, Dream, Kings Pride, Fidibus, etc. These flowers fetch better prices in the world markets than any other cut flowers. ', ' Ethiopia is considered as one of the potential countries in the world for flower production. The country has a wide range of agro-ecological condition that is conducive for varieties of flower growing. The highlands are suitable for long stem and big bud rose flowers and the lowlands are also suitable for short stems and small bud rose flowers. In additions to this because of the proximity of the country to Europe, the Amhara region has a comparative advantage in freight cost over other producing countries of the African continent. There are three major export market options for the Ethiopian cut rose flowers; i.e., Europe, North America and Japan. The biggest flower importing countries are Germany, the Netherlands, France, UK, USA, and Japan. Market for rose flowers is growing due to the quality demanded and the new market development of Eastern Europe. That is why, recently, floriculture has become one of the fastest growing export industries in Africa. For example Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa are significant floriculture producers for export. Recently, Ethiopia is coming in to picture in the floriculture. In less than half a decade about 18 companies have been established and engaged in this business; but limited only to Oromia Region having similar agro-ecological conditions of that of Oromia, the Amhara region has to encourage investors to take part on the floriculture industry. As investment in the floriculture expands, the industry will generate substantial income to all stakeholders and provide employment opportunity to many job seekers of the region. ', ' Because of location proximity and seasonal variation of production season, European countries re the major consumers and producers of floriculture products in the world. But their consumption is much higher that their production; the gap is filled with imports from developing countries (mostly form tropical regions). Plus their production is declining due to decrease in acreage. In addition to this, European countries could not produce flowers during October-February, but have critical demand for important occasions besides to the regular requirements. Hence, the Amhara Regional State, being in a tropical country, can take part in filling the huge demand gap of European countries.', 'For floriculture production, root stocks are the basic inputs both at initial establishment stage and for periodic replacement. Netherlands, Israel and Kenya are major sources of this basic input; hence root stocks can be imported from these countries depending on costs of purchase and the specific varietals requirement. ', 'Root stocks of selected varieties will be planted on raised seed beds in rows at a specified spacing between plants and rows under green house conditions. Rose flower production without green house is inconceivable. From planting date to harvesting time the plant will be supplied with water and fertilizer through drip irrigation system. Depending on the varieties and environmental conditions the flower stem will be ready for harvest in 90-120 days.
 

Cut flowers stems will be collected in buckets, transported to packing houses with out exposing them to direct sunlight. In the packing house cut flower stems will be packed in batch of 20 stems and 18 batches will be again packed in carton boxes which contain 360 stems each.

('Fish Harvesting, Farming and Marketing ', ' If available and affordable, fish diet is a major source of protein which is essential for the development and growth of bones and the brain. Fish harvesting is the collection of mature fish from lakes and rivers and distributing the catch to consumers. Fish farming is growing or breeding fish in man-made ponds and marketing the harvest to consumers. This project idea is for harvesting fish in and around Lake Tana and for growing fish in ponds near the Lake and marketing the harvest from both sources for consumers in major urban areas.', ' The Amhara Region has the largest water bodies in the country and large quantities of fish are harvested every year from the lakes and rivers of the Region. Potential annual fish harvest from Lake Tana is estimated at 15000 tons, but actual harvest in 2002 was 1,450 tons. Up to now the harvesting of fish from lakes and rivers is done by traditional and sometime very destructive method of fishing which results in low production and whole sale destruction of young fish not ready for harvesting. In addition, fishing is done on natural lakes and streams. The method of harvesting fish from man made ponds which is common in many south East Asian countries is practically unknown in Ethiopia including the Amhara Region. If farmers and potential entrepreneurs are made aware about the possibility and benefits of fish farming using man-made ponds, the production of fish would have increased substantially there by increasing the supply of animal protein to the population. This project idea is to undertake moden fish harvesting in Lake Tana and to prepare ponds to grow fish for commercial purposes.', ' Considering the popularity of fish especially during fasting months and days, the market for fish in the Region is more that current fish harvest. In the context of the Ethiopian economy, demand for any food type is not a problem. It is the supply that has been the problem.', ' Fish harvesting on Lake Tana will be done using modern technology and in such a way that only fish of certain sizes will be caught leaving small and young fish to breed and to get matured. In this way the fish population of the Lake will be replenished through breeding which will ensure continuous supply of marketable fish. Harvesting of fish from man made ponds will be done by employing the latest technology and practice in the field. In addition to the immediate benefits, growing fish in man-made ponds will have demonstration effects. These effects will initiate other people (farmers and entrepreneurs) to start breeding fish by preparing man-made ponds in many localities. For harvesting fish and for preparing the harvest for marketing, the following physical assets will be required.

('Fodder Production and Distribution ', 'Fodder is animal feed to be given to domestic animals especially to cattle. Fodder is usually prepared from grass, straws, lucks and seeds. This project idea is to produce animal feed from grass in the form of lay or from leaves in the form of alpha. ', ' Throughout the Amhara region, the sizes of grazing lands have been diminishing every year/ due to the fact these lands are being converted to farms. In almost all parts of the region, there are extreme shortages of both cultivable and grazing land.
About twenty years ago, it was common to see domestic animals grazing in open areas in all parts of the Amhara region both in the dry and rainy seasons. Now in many localities of the region during the people are forced to keep their animals at home during the day because there are no open places (grazing areas) where they can send their animals. It is pity to see these animals tied to poles in the back yards of their owners homes and crying for food or for want to be released. in the Amhara region, domestic animals usually get their food supply by for aging for food in open "grazing" areas. It is only during the rainy season that owners of domestic animals provide some feed for the animals especially for oxen. Hence if animals do not get sufficient food from open areas, they are starved and this happens mainly during the months of February, March, April, May and June. As a result many animals such as horses, cows, and oxen die during these months.
To increase the supply of animals feed in the Amhara region, a new system of producing such feed should be introduced and developed through out the region. And this system is the commercialization of lay/ fodder production in the region. Given the shortage of animal feed in the region, a business venture which will supply hay/ fodder for urban and rural communities will be financially viable. It will be similar to a business entity that produces and distributes grains. Production of hay will take place in fields which the investor will acquire through lease. Using quality or sprinkler irrigation system, hay could be harvested at least three times a year from one field. The source of water could be a reservoir (pond) well or a nearly stream. Distribution of the feed could be done by compacting and tieing the hay. In some cases, the hay could be cut to smaller pieces and bagged for delivery. Hay may not be the only feed to be produced by such farms. Other plants fit for animal feed could also be produced. With more than 25 million domestic animals and extreme shortage of animal feed in the region, it is safe to assume that production of hay/ fodder on commercial basis will be a viable venture.', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' Increases the supply of animal feed, improves the quality of the livestock resources of the region, helps the further development of the livestock sector, increases the income of farmers.', '3', '1'),

In short, with 2.1 million people in its urban centers, the Region has a great potential for the consumption of fruits and vegetables. However, these products are not grown in the Region on large scale commercial basis. As a result, the demand for fruits in the Region is met by imports from other parts of the country. The Region has may localities suitable for growing oranges and other similar fruits. There is also a growing demand for these fruits. Establishing commercial plantations for producing oranges and other similar fruits near Bahir Dar, Gondar and Dessie at the initial stage and moving to other localities will be financially viable ventures. Growing these fruits on the north western parts of the Region will make it possible to export the fruits to north Africa and the middle East.

('Popcorn Production Farm ', 'Three types of seeds or kernels of popcorn are known in the world market, i.e. white, small yellow and large yellow, i.e. white, small yellow and large yellow. White popcorn has a rice shaped seed, are pearl-shaped. The three types are required in the market for different purposes, and growers and /or markets must take that in to consideration when selecting seeds. Popcorn is produced commercially for human consumption as versatile and nutritious snack and enjoyed both sweet and savory by fans around the world. Popcorn is the only type of all corns that actually pops.
To be high quality, popcorn must be free of any contaminations, insect and rodent damage. The volume of popped corn produced form a given weight of unpopped seeds is the most important factor influencing the economic value of popcorn. Research results have indicated that maximum popping from 13.00 to 14.5%, with 13.5% being optimum. Hence popcorn at 14.5% moisture can be safely stored for six months. ', ' There are several thousand of corn (maize) grown through out the world. These cultivars can be grouped in to seven types; namely, dent, flint, sweet, pod, waxy, and popcorns. Hence popcorn is one of the cultivars of maize that can be grown in maize growing areas of the region. Like another maize cultivars, popcorn in a warm weather loving crop. It can be best grown where mean temperature vary between 21-27 0c with annual rain fall range of 600 to 1000mm. Popcorn is reasonably drought tolerant crop at early stage of growth than at later stages. Such suitable areas are available in the region where investors can profitably grow popcorn.', ' Cereals can supply sufficient quantities of carbohydrates. Being one of the cereals grain, popcorn contains mainly carbohydrates. Humans consume popcorn as versatile and nutritious snack and enjoyed both sweet and savory by fans around the world. Hence one factor which makes it popular is its nutritional value. One cup of air-popped popcorn contains 31 calories, 1 gram protein, 6 grams of carbohydrate 1 gram of fiber and a trace of fat. Plus it is a favorite sneak of all consumers of all age. In Ethiopia it is very common snack served at coffee ceremony of every household, bars, restaurants and big hotels.
On the other hand, popcorn is not significantly produced locally s its widely consumed. So far consumption is supplied by import. The current retail price of popcorn (un popped) indicates that consumption is constrained by supply. Popcorn retrial price is birr 10.50 per kg whereas the current price for maize is not more than Birr 2.00 per kg. This signals the need for local production. The Amhara Region has large suitable areas for popper production as indicted in the rational section.', ' The basic raw materials for the production of popcorn are seeds, agro chemicals, fertilizers and packing materials. Except popcorn seeds all are locally available. Improved or hybrids seeds should be imported from USA or any other popcorn producing countries. In the long-run, improved seed producing farms should be encouraged to be developed in the region.', ' Useful seedbed preparation (plowing and disking) is important because the seed size is small a clod -free seedbed with good filth will ensure coverage of the seed placed deep enough to be in contact with moist soil. Hence, popcorn should be planted in clod-free seedbed in a well drained soil. Early planting will assure full maturity of the seed at harvest. Early to Mid-May is an ideal time for popcorn planting and plating population of 50,000 plants /ha for rain-fed and 70,000 plants /ha for irrigation is recommendable to attain high yield.
A soil test is recommended to determine the application rate of fertilizers. With application of irrigation popcorn gives best yield, chemicals commonly used as herbicides are atrazine and lasso or sandoz. Other disease and pests control chemicals can be applied as deemed necessary (consulting the extension service of the region).
 In 90-110 days time, popcorn is ready for harvest. Popcorn is mature when the stalks and leaves are brown and dry, the seeds are hard. Popcorn can be harvested with a combine or labor depending on the scale of operation, costs, and the quality of seeds required with combine costs may be less but there will be more damaged seeds reducing in popping volume. The quality of popcorn will be high with labor but may increase costs.', ' Popcorn is a favorite snack of all consumers of all ages and it is popular for its nutritional value. It is an excellent source of carbohydrate and widely consumed. Hence investment in the production of popcorn will reward investors in the form of profit, generates revenue to the regional states in the form of income tax and VAT.', '3', '1'),
('Poultry production Farm ', '  In general poultry refers to all domestic birds of fowls; but in this project profile it refers only to chicken. Chicken are most popular, widely raised and consumed birds in Ethiopia. Hence the major purpose of poultry production in the country is for food as meat and egg. In commercial poultry production system broiler meat is marketed in the form of live birds, whole dressed, portions such as leg quarter, thighs, whole breast, drumsticks, etc, which may be polybagged or tray packed depending on the requirements of the customers. Two kinds of eggs are also supplied to the market; i.e. table eggs for direct consumption and hatchery eggs for further rearing.
 ', ' Poultry production practice in the Amhara Region is a traditional type; just as a backyard business in which producers rear small number of domestic birds. Production is, basically for home consumption, with a small percentage and seasonal marketable surplus. According to the livestock sample survey of 2005/06, the Amhara Region had 9.40 million poultry population which accounts for 29.2% of the national flock. The marketable surplus is only 20% of the region flock whereas mortality rate is over 60% and the balance is consumed at home.
Urban population in the region is estimate 2,195,000 and relating this figure with the marketable surplus of poultry in the Region, poultry meat consumption level is less than one bird per person per year. This is extremely low by any standard. The low level of marketable surplus is constrained by a host of factors. Traditional producers raised their own stocks which are low p-productive, they take 12 months to gain 1 kg weight whereas improved breeds gain 1 kg body weight in 2 months time. The local breeds give 20-30 eggs per layer per year and the improved breeds gain 200-280 eggs per layer per year. In addition to this in the traditional production system mortality rate is very high due to high incidence of diseases and predator as there is no provision of housing. Birds are properly fed, left to scavenge for food, no provision of veterinary services. There is no differentiation between layer and broiler breeds. As a result poultry production is low. On the other hand urban population is increasing at the rate of 4.25% per year. With the current unsatisfied demand population increase will create addition pressure on poultry meat and egg supply. Hence it is timely to encourage investment in the poultries.', ' Base on statistical Abstract of 2005, total regional population is estimated at 19.12 million of which 12% resides in urban centers. The urban population of the region is growing at more than 4% per year. On the other hand poultry population in the regions is estimate at 9.40 million of which only 20% marketable which indicates a consumption level of less than one bird per person per year.', 'Day-old chicks for both layers and broilers breeds have to be imported from well recognized breeding stock sources. In commercial poultry production feed is the most important variable cost component accounting fort 75-80 percent of th4e production cost. The basic components of feed are maize, Soya bean and oil cakes which can easily be produced and supplied to the poultry industries within the region. ', ' Poultry houses are designed for growing pullet (egg layers), broilers (birds of meat) parent stock (birds for breeding) and each cage house is equipped with automatic feeders, drinkers, controlled  heating and light system where temperature and humidity are controlled. Day-old chicks are vaccinated and the same day delivered to their respective cage house by an environmentally controlled delivery van. Chicks are carefully brooded and fed until they reach their respective production stages layers will start egg-laying in 20 weeks time. Eggs will be collected, stacked in trays and stored for sale. Broilers will gain marketable body weight in 45 days time ready for sale live or dressed.', ' Poultry meat and eggs are relatively cheep but healthy animal protein sources. Because productivity of poultry birds per unit of is very high, its contribution to the food self sufficiency effort will be great.

('Rubber Tree Plantations ', ' These are tropical broad a leafed tree from which to a material called latex is extracted from the trunk of the trees. Latex is used for producing different types of rubber products including, rubber tires crashers, shoe soles rubberized fabrics Malysia and Brazil have huge rubber tree plantations and they produce the largest volume of natural rubber latex.
', ' ',  'The raw material for the sole tyre making factory (matador Addis Tyre Factory) comes for foreign sources. To produce natural rubber latex in the country, a rubber tree plantation scheme was established in the former Illubabor province.
Up now not much latex production has been achieved by the plantation.The use of different types of rubber products in Ethiopia will increase and this will necessitate the importation or domestic production of natural rubber latex. Tires are strategic products from the point of view of national security and economic independence. If imported supplies of red made tires or latex are disrupted by causes beyond the control of the national government, the whole economy and the capability of national defense will be adversely affected. This is because the movement of people and goods will be disrupted.
Given this, it is imperative that every attempt should be made to produce both the raw material and the final product of this strategic item here at home.Ethiopia imports some 3000 tons of different types of raw rubbers (costs Birr 60 million) annually. In contrast to this, however, the report of the National Project of Rubber Plantation and Processing (NPRPP) suggests the countrys rubber import amounts to 6,000 tons annually.
Currently, Ethiopia has expanded its plantation by over 10 folds during the past three years. According to the report of the National Project of Rubber Plantation and Processing under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the pilot project launched in southwest Ethiopia on 46 hectares of land has jumped to 500 hectares. The pilot project is expected to yield up to 30 tons of latex annually. Although the trend is encouraging, as compared to the country’s need, this output is insignificant. In order to meet the country’s demand for raw rubber locally, thousands of hectares of land need to be cultivated.
Some localities in the Amhara region have the necessary climatic conditions to grow rubber trees. Localities in West Gojam and Awi Zones are identified to be suitable for growing rubber trees. If this case, plantations for growing rubber should be established to produce the foreign dependency of this critical product.According to the report of Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, the country’s economy is growing at 10 % growth rate annually. It is realistic if we assume that the country’s demand for raw rubber will increase in the future by the same rate. Moreover, this project profile takes the CSA’s import statistics (i.e. 3000 tons of rubber import per annum) as a base figure to project the country’s rubber demand under the lowest scenario and that of NPRPP (i.e. 6000 tons of rubber import per annum) to project the demand under the highest scenario.

What ever their purpose, in advanced countries seedlings re grown and distributed on commercial basis ', ' ', ' Prompted by the ever increasing deforestation going on in the country attempts are being made to restore and conserve the forest resource of the country. During the last 25-30 years, afforestation activities have been under taken in almost all parts of the country. State agencies at the local level have been responsible of supplying seedlings for the reforestation programmers. But seedlings provided by local state agencies have been limited both in number and variety. In almost all cases only seedlings of eucalyptus trees were supplied to farmers and other people involved in tree planting. In addition, not enough number of seedlings was produced for the reforestation activates. The fact that production and distribution of seedlings is limited to local state agencies has to some extent hampered the expansion of the reforestation activities in the countries. To increase the Varity of plant species to be planted and to increase the quality and quantity of seedlings to be produced, the private sector must be involved in the production and distribution of seedling on commercial scale.
Such commercial venture will be under taken as a small scale business enterprise and will operate in many localities through out the Amhara region.
The major consumers for seedlings will be peasant farmers, urban dwellers, schools, churches, municipalities, NGOs, state local agencies, fruits and vegetable growers, commercial farmers and any entity interested in the rehabilitation of the regions plant resources.', ' In this case "raw materials" refers to seeds from which seedlings grow.

('Seed Multiplication and Distribution Centers ', ' Seed multiplication and distribution centers are production, storage and marketing enterprises where selected seeds (natives and foreign) are harvested and stored in selected locations of the Region and distributed to farmers in the Region. These centers could have specialized seed multiplication functions in different agri-ecological zones depending on the type of seeds required in each zone. The seeds to be multiplied will be those of high yielding varieties and/or disease resistant or which in general have a superior quality than seeds being used in current farming practices. ', ' ', 'One of the major complaints for lower farm productivity in the Region is the lack of seeds which are high yielding, disease resistant and less susptible to drought. To overcome this major problem, research and seed multiplication centers have been established in a selected number of sites in the country. However, these centers do not supply enough quantities of seeds to farmers. Consequently, selected seeds are imported to meet existing demand. Even the existing seed multiplication centers are located in areas which are far away from the central parts of the Amhara Region. Currently, there are a number of agricultural research centers in the Region. These centers are engaged in testing and determining the most appropriate types of seeds for the different agro-climatic zones of the Region. Once seed varieties are selected they should be multiplied, cleaned, stored and distributed to farmers. These functions can only be done effectively if there are enterprises which undertake seed multiplication and distribution activities on commercial basis. These enterprises will receive selected seeds from the research centers and multiply them on their commercial farms and also on farms owned by individual through out-growers schemes. The potential demand for selected seeds of different variety in the Region is huge. These seeds can be grouped as cereals, pulses and oil seeds. The demand for selected seeds of cereals could be in tens of thousands of tons every year. The Amhara Region usually produces about one third of the cereals production of the country. For example, in 2004/05, national production of cereals was 106.5 million quintals and the share of the Amhara Region was about 35 million quintals. If we assume that the average input- output ratio of cereals is 1:20, the total seed requirement for cereals in 2004/05 was about 1.75 million quintals. This was the potential demand for selected varieties of cereal seeds in the Region. If we assume that at least 50 percent of the seed requirement will be selected seeds, the aggregate demand for these seeds would have been about 0.87 million quintals in 2004/05. As more and more farmers realize the benefits of using selected seeds, the demand for these seeds will increase every year.

One kg. of pineapple is sold for Birr 34 while the same quantity of oranges are sold for about Birr 3.50. In fact it is only in Addis Ababa that the fruits are sold. While some quantities of pineapple are produced in areas like Gamo in the South, most of the pineapple supplied to the Addis Ababa market is imported. Separate data on the volume of imports of pineapples is not available as they are included with other fruit imports. However one can safely assume that there is a captive market for locally produced pineapple in Addis Ababa and in a few major urban areas. Introduced by foreign missionaries, pineapple is being produced in the highlands of the former Gamo and Goffa province which is now part of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region. many highland parts of the Amhara Region have very similar climatic conditions with those existing in the South. With the introduction of pineapple seeds to the highland areas of the Amhara Region and the appropriate assistance by development agents, farmers can grow pineapple trees in their backyards like other perennial tree-crops. Production from these backyards could generate substantial cash income to the growers and could also meet local demand. However to have large production volume for the national market and replace imports of pineapples, commercial farming of the fruit is necessary. These commercial farms of 5 to 20 hectares could be established in the highland lands of the Amhara Region.

The protein content of other legumes varies from 20-25% while that of soybeans is 40% which is comparable to some animal source protein. Soybean protein is much cheaper than protein from animal sources. Despite this wide range of benefits from the crop, there is no supply of soybean in the region.
On the other hand, the Amhara region has large potential areas suitable for soybeans growing. All maize, sorghum and millet producing areas in the region are also suitable for soybeans production. Hence, soybeans can be widely produced in mid and low altitudes of Awi, West Gojam and North Gondar zones of the regions.
  ', ' The region has a total population of 19.4 million. Unbalanced and inadequate nutrition is prevailing on the region. The food intake of the people is dominated by cereals which is rich starch but poor in probe in content. Soybean is a grain legume with very high quality protein requirement of the people if it can be provided with cereal food. For example, soybean with maize, soybeans with wheat or rice could provide a balanced diet to the people of region. In this regard soybean has great potential markets in the region.
On the other hand, soybean can be supplied a raw materials to several industries. Soybean seed could be used by flour mill to make soybean flour which could be mixed with wheat flour to produce several kinds of baked good. Soybean flour can be also used in the making of candies and ice cream soybean seeds can also be used to process Soya … which can be used in infant feeding. Soya sauce is also produced from soybean seeds to be used as a sauce.  Mature soybean seeds are also required by oil industry to produce Soya oil. The oil can be used as cooking and salad oil. The oil is also used industrially in the manufacture of paints printing ink, soaps, synthetic fiber adhesive etc.
All these kinds of agro food processing and manufacturing industries could have been initiated in the country as well as in the Amhara region if there was adequate supply of soybean.
The by-product of say milk and oil is Soya Cake which is rich in protein Soy-cake is highly required as animal feed. It is one of the basic constituents of concentrate of animal feed. There are already constraints or big short fall in soybean supply in the poultry industry in the country. The poultry industry is at its beginning stage yet, almost there is no soybean cake supply.

Marketing, finance labour and knowledge will be very important factors in determining the vineyard size. Knowledge of the grapes natural requirements (Climate, soil, site, and planting materials), crop management plan (vine training, pruning systems, varieties selection, weed control, disease and pest control etc) should precede planting. Healthy one year old root stocks should be used for planting. Vines should be ordered from a well known source well in advance of the planting date. A hole as large as the root system is required to plant the vine. After planting, pack the soil tightly around the vine and water it immediately with sufficient water.

( ' Simple Glass Mirrors Making Plant', ' Sprayed Polymer Mortar', '"Gascon" Polymer mortar is an intermediate construction material used for the construction of low cost housing and  other building structures such as barns, stores, cattle shades, etc. It is a light weight (100 pcf) structural (3000 psi) mortar made by adding a liquid polymer additive known as Gascon to standard batches of cement, sand and water. The main advantages of this construction material are it eliminates cold-joint delamination and shrinkage cracking during spray application; it is an excellent thermal insulator; it does not require forms in the construction of conventional and thin-shell reinforced concrete structures; it requires 30% less material than do conventional methods; it results in a 30% reduction of gravity loads as well as a 30% reduction of earth quake forces; and it is fireproof, termite-proof, dry rot proof and earthquake and typhoon resistant. The material can be widely used for constructing houses for low income people both in the rural and urban areas of the Region.  ', 'Except in some sections of the urban centers, all houses in the Region can be considered as substandard. If the standard of living of the people permits, almost 90 percent of the houses need upgrading or replacement. But forced by poverty, the overwhelming majority of the people in the Amhara region live in houses unfit for human habitation by the standards of even recently developed countries. One of the major constraints for the poor or sub-standard housing in the Amhara Region is the lack or shortage of affordable modern construction materials such as mortars, roofing products, doors, windows, etc. Practically all the industrial construction materials consumed in the region are either imported from abroad or from other parts of the country. On top of increasing prices of these materials, the transportation cost makes them very expensive to house builders of the region. Building materials such "Gascon" polymer mortar will reduce the cost of construction thereby increasing the number of people who can build better homes with improved standards. In every urban center of the Region, there are extreme shortages of residential houses for every class of people:- civil servants, merchants, young couples and other social groups. As a result, people are forced to pay exorbitant rents for small rooms or "houses". If construction costs decrease due to inexpensive building materials, more and more people will be able to build their own houses.  Of the 19.2 million people (2006) living in the Amhara Region, about 2.2 million (11.5 percent) live in urban areas. Of these urban residents, it is safe to assume that at least 50 percent do not have their own houses. This means that about 1.1 million people or 220,000 families do not own their own houses. If we assume that one family needs 50m2 of a house (at the minimum), the housing requirement for the 220,000 families will be 11 million m2 or 220,000 units. To build a 502 house, about 25,000 m3 of "Gascon" polymer mortar is needed. Hence to build 11 million m2 of houses, about 5.5 million m3 of the product will be needed. This is the potential demand for "Gascon" polymer mortar in the Region. If we assume that these housing units will be built in the next 10 years (with out considering additional annual demand), the annual demand for the mortar will be 0.55 million m3. This demand can absorb the production capacity of many polymer mortar producing units to be located in the Region.   ', ' The main inputs are cement, sand and a liquid polymer additive called Gascon.

As a result, people are not provided with proper facilities for taking bathes in their homes.  This is a serious hygienic problem which has negative consequence on the health situation of people living under such conditions.  Immersion heaters are very convenient gadgets both in terms of price and handling for facilitating the shower and bath needs of people.  Promoting the production and distribution of immersion heaters can not be considered from the point of industrial development, but it should also be seen from the stand point of health care development.  Hence, production of immersion heaters should promoted on a priority basis by the Region.

The insulating materials usually used are fibrous sheet material like cellulose, paper glass or nylon impregnated with a thermosetting thing resin binder and then consolidated under high temperature and pressure into solid sheets. The metal used is generally copper. PCBs are used to transmit power from one end to another. PCBS are largely used by manufacturers of electronics components like. T.V sets, transistors, radios, amplifiers, ampligrams, Voltage stabilizers, calculators, telecommunication equipment, power suppliers, public address equipments, computers. etc.',  '  Printed circuit boards are needed in almost all electrical and electronic products and these products are many both in kind and number. One can witness the type and quantity of electrical and electronic products that are available in the market by going through some market areas in Addis Ababa and all other large and small urban centers in the country. There is too much in variety and too many in number.  Most of these numerous electrical and electronic products use printed circuit boards for their operation. They can not repartee without CPBs. The volume of imports of electrical and electronic products certainly justifies the establishment of plants which can produce some of the major electrical and electronic products such as radio, tape recorders, television, etc. PCBs are the brains of these and other products.
In our country, there are expanding markets to justify the establishment of radio, tape recorder and other household electronic and electrical products making plants. The PCBs are the most essential components of these products.

Even with this growing demand, the per capital consumption of electrical and electronic products Ethiopia is one of the lowest in the world. With 75 million people, Ethiopia has a long way to reach world average level of consumption in electrical and electronic products. This indicates that the market for these products will further expand. With 19.2 million people, the Amhara Region has also a good market for electrical and electronic products and also for printed circuit boards. If we assume that the potential demand for radio is one radio for one family, the potential demand for radio is 3.84 million. This means that 3.84 million printed circuit boards will also be required. These indicative figures give a general picture on the potential demand for PCBs.

This conducting material is removed or etched away from certain places so as to form conducting and insulting paths as required. Holes are dilled through the board at desired points so that components may be mounted through them. After suitable processing, the board is dipped into a tank containing a solution of ferric chloride or cupric chloride with sulphuric acid or hydrogen peroxide to etch those portions of the copper layer which are not covered by protective materials. The etching agent reacts with the copper and is removed to reveal the insulating material below.
For the manufacture of PCBs, photo resist is first applied to the surface of the PCB where the copper is to be etched. Then a photograph is taken of the drawing made on cellophane paper of the circuit with tracks covered by tape. The negative of the photograph will have the areas covered with track markings in tape which is a shade lighter than the rest of the board. (Other processes follow for the completing the PCBs.)

But production of the oil for the export market might be more attractive financially.',  ' ', 'A study made some years ago estimated that the country produces between 10,000 and 15,000 tons of castor seeds per year. However, production of castor seeds in not considered as a normal farming activity by many farmers. Castor seeds naturally grow around homesteads and in marginal lands with no much attention given by farmers. If proper care could be given by farmers for the production of these seeds, the harvest could have been much larger than the figures indicated above. Considering the market potential for castor oil, there were preliminary attempts to establish castor oil producing plants as early as the 1960s. But so far no plant has been established. The price of castor oil in the international markets varies from USD 650/ton to USD 900/tons and the average factory gate price could be USD 665/ton which is equivalent to about Birr 6000/ton. This indicates that castor oil production can be a good foreign exchange earner. India and Brazil dominate the international market for castor oil. One study has indicated that the market in Europe for the oil ranges from 35,000 to 50,000 tons. Thus the objective of a castor oil producing plant should be to export its product. ', ' Localities in the Amhara region which are suitable for producing castor seeds.', ' As the first step castor seeds are cleaned in shaking screens of various sizes and then are fed to multiple stage steam heated cookers in order to be conditioned. Then the seeds are taken to the expeller (press) as needed. The expeller breaks up the seed and subjects them to pressure, thus extracting oil which is expelled from the machine and can be stored in drums.
The expelled oil should be left to settle for about two days, so the sediments will settle to the bottom and the oil can be decanted. The oil is finally pumped to the filter for further clarification. The oil discharged from the filter is taken to storage or packing facilities. Main machinery needed include cooker, expeller, filter press, seed cleaner, and other accessories.

( ' Commercial starch', ' Starch is a basic need for people and it is also an input for many types of industries. Starch is mostly used or consumed in its natural form, but it is also converted to other forms. Glucose, for example, is one of the varieties of products which is prepared from starch. Glues of different kinds can also be made from starch which is used as adhesives in many industries such as paper printing. Commercial starch is mostly prepared from corn and potatoes. In industry, starch is used as sizing, finishing, binding, and diluting agent, adhesive and water absorber in the textile, paper, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic and confectionery industries. Glucose and syrups are the major derivatives of starch with high commercial value.',  'While the raw materials for making starch are adequately available at home, the country has been importing starch and associated products from abroad by spending badly needed foreign exchange resources. As many other economic phenomena this is also another animally which defies explanations. Next to the food and beverages sectors, textile is the largest industrial sector in the country. And this industry consumes a large amount of starch which is imported. So do the paper and printing industries. Even the two big textile mills in the Amhara Region Consume a substantial quantity of starch. With the current dietary habits of the population, household consumption of starch is small when seen against the total population. However, with increasing urbanization and industrialization the demand for starch will grow and this will necessitate the establishment of a commercial starch producing Plant. The Amhara Region, being one of the largest corn and potatoes growing regions in the country, is a good candidate for having a starch production plant. ', 'In 1990, consumption of starch was estimated to be about 2000 tons; and demand for 2005/06 was projected to be 6000 tons which is an increase of 3.5 times. Since there is no commercial starch producing plant, all this demand is being met imports. The current demand for starch definitely justifies the establishment of a plant which will at least meet part of the starch requirement of the country. ', ' Maize or potatoes are the main raw materials for producing starch and these will be obtained from local sources.', ' The simplified production process is as follows. Steeping:- this is to soften the kernels so that subsequent milling operations and separations can be carried out efficiently. Determination:- oil rich germ is separated from starch, gluten, hulls and fiber. Then the corn is ground in attrition mills. When the material leaves the mill, it becomes a mixture of water, starch, gluten, germs and hulls. It is further fed to mills which grind the material to very small particle sizes. After removing the hulls and fiber particles by passing it on a set of querulous, the starch and gluten are allowed to separate using gravitational methods. Separation of starch from gluten:- using this process heavy starch is deposited on the bottom and the gluten is removed at the top of the lower end of the tables especially designed and manufactured for this purpose. Major plant and machinery needed include steeping tanks; mills screen bends, hydro cyclones, centrifugal machines and dryers.', 'Promotes self sufficiency in a critical industrial product, saves foreign exchange and regional financial resources, stimulates the production of corn and potato crops, contributes to the health improvement of the people, and introduces new skills and technology.

( ' Composite flour', ' Composite flour is a mixture of cereals or legumes or the combination of both. Cereals in composite flour processing include sorghum, wheat, barley and maize. The legumes are beans, peas, chick peas and soybeans. In most cases, composite flour is delivered packed in plastic bags of either 5kg or 10kg. The main nutritional value of composite flour (if it is a mixture of cereals and legumes), is that it contains both carbohydrates and proteins which is particularly useful for feeding children.',  ' ', 'Considering its nutrition content, the main consumers of composite flour are mother and children. This group of people comprises about 56 percent of the population in the Amhara region. This translates in to 10.8 million people (2006). The potential consumption of composite flour by mother and children in the Amhara Region is the potential demand for this product in the region. If we assume that one potential consumer of the product consumes about 50gm of composite flour per day, total potential annual demand of the product in the region could reach about 196100 tons (10.8 million X .05 kg X 365). However, given the level of income of the overwhelming majority of the people in the Amhara region, it is unrealistic to expect that all the potential consumers will actually consume composite flour. Hence, to be on the safe side, we have assumed that only 30 percent of the potential customers will consume composite flour in the region. With this assumption, the annual demand for the product under consideration will be 59130 tons. As population increases and the level of personal income grow, this annual demand will also increase. This roughly estimated demand for composite flour will be sufficient to absorb the production of more than two medium sized flour mills and the region. ', ' As mentioned above, the main raw materials for composite flours are cercal (wheat, barley, and oats) and legumes (peas, beans, click peas, lentils.). The Amhara region is one of the regions in the country, where these groups of crops grow relatively in large quantities. The region will supply sufficient quantities of these crops for the plants to be established.', 'The raw materials are first cleaned by a separator and suction filter. Then it is scoured after being weighted in the weighing section. It is stored in the dampener where water is added for dreiching. Milling is then performed and inserted into the square sifter. Next it is delivered to a double deck purifier and then to the needling mill. Finally the products are mixed in a mixing vessel according to proportional mix ratio. It will then be inspected, weighed and packed.

Between 1999 and 2005, average annual domestic production of confectionery (all candy) was 1356 tons. An equal amount of confectionery in the form of gums, chocolate and other types of sweets is assumed to have been imported every year. Confectionery production in the Amhara Region is confined to very small candy making units which cater to their respective narrow local markets. The quality of their products is much below that of any standard candy produced by modern candy factories. Much of the confectionery products consumed in the Region is either produced in other regions of the country or is imported from other countries. If we take consumption of candy from domestic production, the consumption share of the Amhara Region is about 350 tons per year. This consumption volume from domestic production alone can justify the establishment of a modern confectionery producing plant in the Region ', 'Almost all the raw material for confectionery making (except chocolate) will be obtained form domestic sources. ', 'For making hard candies the mixture of the main ingredients (sugar, glucose, citric acid powder, oil of lemon, color…) is cooked in open pans or a steam jacketed kettle. A temperature of 150-1600c is maintained during cooking. The cooked mixture is transferred quickly to an oiled water cooled table and mixed with coloring and flavoring agent. The material is now ready for moulding into desirable shape manually or automatically. The moulded product is air dried and the finished candies are than twist wrapped for sale. Main types of equipment of a confectionery plant which will produce all types of confectionery products include: powder mixing machine, sugar grinder, copper pan for sugar boiling, working tables, pedal press, automatic rotary machine with cutter revolving coating pan, roller and cutter, sizing machine, coal fired furnace and other accessories.

( ' Cornfleaks', ' Cornflakes is a type of food made from corn flour and usually eaten during breakfast. It is similar to sliced and dried or roasted potato chips',  ' ', ' Corn or maize is one of the major crops grown in the Amhara Region. Corn does not constitute one of the staple foods in the Amhara Region. It is rarely consumed in a form of bread or “Injera”. The popular from of consumption of corn is to roast the corn seeds while they are on the shales. In some localities corn is used to make home-made beer. In times of food shortages corn flour is made into injera and consumed. Currently corn constitutes a very small portion of the diet of an average family. One major advantage that corn has is that productivity per unit of hand and labor is much higher than many other crops. Corn flakes are new types of foods for many ordinary families in the country. However, in practically all western counties they are the basic breakfast diets. Given its large production per unit of land, corn can be a major source of food if people are used to the different types of diet that could be made from the crop. One type of diet is corn flakes. Up to now, all the corn flakes consumption of the country is met by imports. With domestic production of corn flakes, import of the production will be replaced and with proper marketing strategy local consumption will increase. If corn flakes are popular in the west, there is n o reason why they can not be in our country ', 'Practically all zones of the Region have localities which can produce corn. ', ' Similar to the manufacturing of all food items, the process of manufacturing corn flakes starts with the cleaning of the raw material – corn. Cleaning is done through a series of stages until the corn is completely free from foreign material. Then follows the operation of grinding and making the corn in to different grades of flour. After this, the flour is converted into dough whereby it is made into different but thin or flat shapes before cooking. After cooking the flakes are packed.', ' Stimulates production of corn and increases income of corn farmers, introductions new diet to the region, creates possibilities for exporting corn flakes to other regions.' , '6 ' , ' 1'),
( ' Dehydrated vegetable', ' Dehydration of vegetables is the process of reducing moisture of vegetables so that micro-organism do not grow and spoil it and the natural qualities are not harmed to any appreciable extent.  Dehydration is carried out in closed chambers by mechanical means under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity in such a way that the product is attractive, tasty and nutritious.  Dehydrated vegetables are considerably less in weight and volume and can be preserved for a long time.  Due to low cost of dehydrated vegetables compared with canned products, a plant which produces these items has a better and wider market.',  ' At harvest time, the production volume of many types of vegetables is greater than the consumption volume during harvest.  Consequently the surplus quantity which is perishable cannot be stored to be consumed or sold after harvest.  Faced with this problem producers sell the vegetables for much lower or even at a “throw-away” prices. In the Amhara region, these problems are faced by producers of potatoes, onions, tomatoes, and other vegetables and fruits.  Due to lack of culture in dehydration, so much vegetable products are wasted every year in many localities of the region.
', ' Dehydration of vegetables is not a common practice, at least on commercial basis, in the Amhara region and the market for dehydrated products has not yet developed.  Because of this, it is difficult to predict the potential market for dehydrated vegetables.  However, if there are markets for undehydrated vegetables (i.e. fresh vegetables) one can safely assume that there will be sufficient market for dehydrated vegetables which has only lost their natural taste.', 'All localities in the Region which produce vegetables especially those which are closer to the main urban areas. ', 'Vegetables which are suitable for dehydration are onions, potatoes, peas, ginger, garlic, cauliflower, cabbage, beans, carrot, lady fingers, etc.  Vegetables to be dehydrated are graded according to size, stage of freshness, tenderness; and they are washed thoroughly to remove foreign matters.  The vegetables are then peeled to remove upper skin.  The method depends on the types of vegetable being processed.  Potatoes are peeled by abrasive wheels; onions by hand whereas peas are deshelded by pea huller.  Potatoes and other similar vegetables are then sliced in a slicer.  Peas are pricked in a pricking machine.
There are treatments employed to arrest the action of undesirable enzymes present in the fresh vegetables.  All vegetables except onions, ginger and garlic are given this treatment.  This treatment is known as blanching and sulphating.  For blanching vegetables are dipped in boiling water or steam while sulphitation involves the treatment of the vegetable with sodium sulphite or bisulphate.  This treatment increases the storage or shelf life of dried products, improves the color and protects the vitamin content.  The final stage is dehydration and packing.  Depending on the type of vegetable and quantity to be hydrated, various types of driers are used such as tray drier, rotary kiln drier and tunnel drier, etc.  Time and temperature of dehydration depend on the vegetable and it takes 1 to 12 hours to reduce moisture content to below 5 percent.  After drying the vegetables are tested for moisture and sulphur content; and it is packed in moisture proof paper.  Time between unloading from the drier and packing should not be more than half and hour for better results.

It is also mixed with teff or wheat flour to make injera or bread.  In some lowland areas of the Region such as Mettema, maize is a staple food.  This project idea is to produce maize flour for regional and local consumption using the dry milling process.  The present pattern of food consumption in the Region has a sufficient demand for maize flour to justify the establishment of a small scale flour mill for processing maize.', ' The main source of maize in the Region is the eastern part of the Region along the Woldiya-Debre Sina road.', 'There are two types of technologies for producing maize flour; these are wet and dry milling processes.  Wet milling is a highly sophisticated and capital intensive process.  Pounding, the traditional small scale method of producing maize flour is also very wasteful.  This project idea considers an alternative small scale method- dry milling by machine which greatly reduces waste.  Dry milling is done using power mills such as hammer mills and plate mills.  In this process, the relatively hard and tough peels and embryos are thoroughly broken up and incorporated in the meal together with the starch.

In other seasons, the very crops which were in large supply one or two months before are not available in the market.  One main cause of this fluctuation in the supply of fruits and vegetable is the lack of preservation system for these produces.

The demineralization process is where ossein (decalcified bone) is produced by tracing ground degreased bones with hydrochloric acid of 30%-35% concentrations. Demineralization yields a by-product called dicalcium phosphate by controlled precipitation. The slurry is then further processed and dried to be sold for cattle feed. After acidulation and removal of the by product dicalcium phosphate what remains is the declassified bone assign which is now acidic. It is then washed and immersed in quicklime medium to alter its PH to alkaline state and also to depolymerize the collagen component. The liming process takes between 55 and 100 days. The assign is then washed and neutralized by acid treatment for further processing.
The next major process is extraction and filtration which is conducted in stainless steel tanks with temperature ranging between 50oc and 100C and duration of about 52 hours. The extraction process results in a gel solution. This is then passed to primary filtration to remove course particles. Deionization is required for gelatin used for pharmaceutical, most food grades and photographic use. The gel solution is then passed to secondary filtration where fine suspended particles together traces of residual grease are removed. The solution is then evaporated under vacuum in two stages to increase the solid concentration from 5% or 6% to 15% or 18%. A third filtration process may be required to remove any suspended particles left in the partially concentrated gelatin liquor.
The final major process is chilling, drying and blending. The PH and redox state of gelatin is checked and adjusted by adding chemicals before chilling quickly reduces the temperature of  the solution from 55oc to 23oc and the gelatin acquires a from extruded moudles. The chilled gelatin is then dried where by the moisture content is reduced to about 11 percent. The drying process results in a gelatin which has a form of mat which is broken to 20mm. long pieces. After under going testing the gelatin is ground to a desired size and packed.

( ' Glucose', 'Glucose is a viscous syrup liquid which is a mixture of dextrose, maltose and other higher oligosaccharide, derived from starch by acid or enzyme hydrolysis and about 20 percent water. A considerable amount of glucose is used for processing in breweries, pharmaceutical, tobacco, tanning, paper and adhesive industries. It has also many applications in canning; food preserving, baking and dairy. Basically, there are at least four types of glucose. These are acid converted glucose syrup, high maltose glucose syrup, high converted glucose syrup and high maltose low dextrose syrup. Each type has distinct characteristics based on the content and proportions of its ingredients. ',  ' Rationale: As stated above, glucose has many applications, in different industries especially in the pharmaceutical industry. In public health, glucose is considered as a life-saving product since it is given to patients who can not take their diets through the normal process. In this regard, glucose can be considered as one of the most essential pharmaceutical products which should always be available in all health care institutions. But this essential product is not produced in a Region with a population of 19.2 million and which has a number of hospitals and many clinics and health posts. In fact domestic production of glucose does not meet domestic requirement even at the national level. The country is dependent on imports for this critical life-saving product. As population increases, the demand for glucose will increase making the country more dependent. To be self sufficient in the supply of glucose, production of this product at home should be promoted and encouraged ', ' Some studies indicate that for medical purposes alone, the demand for glucose in 2006 is about 22000 tons per year and the share of the Amhara Region is 5620 tons. Meeting this demand can be a viable venture for an investor in the Region. This demand could be augmented by demand from neighboring regions like Bene-gumuz and parts of a neighboring country such as Eastern Sudan.', ' The main inputs for making glucose are maize starch, activated carbon, soda-ash, HCL acid and water. Almost all these inputs will be imported.', 'Slurry of starch of about 60% water is prepared and treated with HCL acid in a converter where the reaction takes place at 1500c and maintained for 15 minutes. The treated slurry is then transferred to wooden vats where it is neutralized with soda-ash solution. Then it is filtered and further refined by activated carbon. Then it passes through a vacuum evaporator where it gets the required concentration. After being cooled the product is packed ready for shipping. Main plant and machinery include slurry  preparation tank, converter, glow tank, wooden vat, filter press, refining vessel, vacuum saporator,  pumps, soiler and accessories, water treatment plant and laboratory equipment.

The oil is used as a substitute for olive oil and other edible oils, soaps, salad and cooking oil, mayonnaise and margarine. The meal is an important component of feeds for poultry and cattle.',  ' ', 'Total apparent consumption (local and imported) during the past seven years ranged from 30,266 tons (2003) to 129,839 tons (2005).  The mean apparent consumption in those years was 66,818 tons and this amount is considered to represent current effective demand for the year 2006. Moreover, in order to estimate the present ( 2008) demand it is assumed that demand for the product grows at a rate of 5% which is equivalent to the growth of population. Accordingly, taking the year 2006 apparent consumption as a base and applying a growth rate of 5% the current unsatisfied demand which excludes local production is estimated at  65,622 tons.

The total annual cost of raw and auxiliary materials is estimated to be Birr 10,059,620', ' Edible oil technology can be grouped into two: mechanical pressing and solvent extraction.  Sometimes the latter compliments the former.  For oilseeds with high oil content such as ground nut, first mechanical pressing will be applied and over 85% of the oil will be extracted.  The remaining oil in the expeller cake will then be extracted with solvent.  For some other oilseed with low oil content, solvent extraction is generally considered as the best alternative.  However, the initial investment cost of solvent extraction is much higher than mechanical pressing.  In addition, solvent extraction is more appropriate for large scale processing than small scale edible oil plants', ' ' , '6 ' , ' 1'),

Water needed for the production of infusion solutions has to be of extremely high quality, which can be achieved only by special purification treatment. The steps needed for the treatment of the water are pre filtration, active carbon filtration, sterile filtration, demineralization via ion exchanger (anion/ cation columns), de mineralized water storage tank, pre filtration of de mineralized water and sterile filtration of de mineralized water. The distillation unit is fed with fully de mineralized water; the distillate is generated by multi-step  evaporators and subsequent condensation.

( ' Iodized salt', ' Iodized salt is edible salt where iodine is added. The addition of iodine to edible salt is essential to avoid goiter and other related health problem.',  ' ', 'The necessity of salt to humans is too obvious to tell. It is one of the essential food flavoring ingredient which is added to almost all types of foods. However, iodine has to be added to salt to make the salt safer for human consumption. Hence the use of iodine as an additive element to salt is as necessary as salt itself. In other words, salt must be iodized to make it more useful as a basic consumption item. During the last 10-15 years, iodization of salt was not as common as it was during the previous decades. It has been reported in state and private newspapers that the salt we consume is not iodized. This has increased the number of people with goiters in many parts of the country. The Amhara Region suffers the most by the lack of iodized salt because almost all the salt that is consumed by the people of the Region is not iodized. The consequence of consuming unionized salt is felt after duration of some years and this reduces the pressure on the relevant authorities to take action for providing iodized salt for the people. The question of market for iodized salt does not arise since the unionized salt is being consumed by the 20 million people of the Region.

( ' Jam and Jelly', '  These are processed and preserved fruits which are canned or bottled for distribution. Jams are prepared by boiling fruit pulp with sufficient quantity of sugar. The final product of jams should contain no less than 68.5 percent of soluble solids. Jellies are prepared by boiling the fruit with or without water, straining, mixing the strained and clear juice extract with sugar and boiling the mixture to a stage at which it will set to a clear gel. Marmalade is a fruit jelly in which slices of the fruit or the peel are in suspension. Marmalade is usually associated with the product made from citrus fruits like oranges and lemons in which shredded peel is included as the material in suspension.',  'Almost all parts of the Amhara Region are suitable for growing different kinds of fruits and vegetables. Fruits like orange, lemon, banana, etc can grow in many places, where there is a potential of irrigation. Unfortunately, since these crops do not constitute the main staple food of the people, they are not grown widely. Until recently fruits and vegetables have never been cash crops in practically all parts of the Region, except in the two or three larger towns. For these reasons, farmers did not have strong interest in producing citrus and other fruits. However, as urbanization expands and more people live in towns, the consumption of fruits and vegetables has increased especially during the last 10 years. The demand for such fruits in the Amhara Region is being met by imports from the Awash Valley and western Wollega which are more than 600 kms and 500 km from Bahir Dar respectively. Having Lake Tana and Abay at its center and other rivers distributed throughout the Region, the Amhara Region imports fruits from far off places in the country. The Region can easily produce fruits not only for its consumption but for export and for converting the fruits to jams and jellies. ', ' The supply of jams and jellies is composed of imports and domestic production. The domestic supply comes from one single plant located in the Awash Valley. A casual observation of shops in major urban areas indicates that imported jams and jellies dominate the market.

In 2005, annual production was 2863 tons while in 2003 and 2005, yearly production was 155 tons and 108 tons, the main reason for this fall in production could be the flooding of the market by imports. Jams and jellies are canned products which have considerable weight. As a result, transporting them long distances increases their prices because of high transportation costs. Because the raw materials are perishables, plants which produce jams and jellies are located near main fruits growing areas.

Unfortunately this is not the case.  There is no any urban center in the whole Region where there is a commercial supply of pasteurized milk and other processed milk products.  Small quantities of raw milk are supplied to consumers in some urban centers by people who keep two three cows in their yard.  The main problem for the near-absence of any commercial milk production and processing entities in the Region is that the market is not properly explored and exploited.  We should be aware that the Amhara society is a very traditional society.  As such the introduction of “new” products to the market, no matter how the products are useful, need concerted efforts to convince people to use these new products. What is a common consumption item when it is produced at home becomes a strange product when it is offered for sale in the market.  It is common to consume milk and milk products when they are produced at home, but uncommon when they are produced commercially and offered for sale.  Probably this is why there are no milk production and processing commercial enterprises in the Region. In any hotel in the Region, a guest can not find a bottle of pasteurized milk, cheese, yogurt or butter.  Is this not strange?

( ' Pea canning ', 'Preservation of food stuffs has been conceived as an art of living ever since the dawn of human history. At present, various methods of preserving food can be cited, such as canning, refrigeration, drying, salt-pickling, sugar preservation and smoking. The scope of the study is the preservation of dried pea canning from the time it is delivered to the plant until it arrives at the wholesale customer.
The protein concentration of peas range is from 15.5-39.6%, which can be consumed in either roasted, boiled or in any other forms. Dried pea canning is preferred than fresh pea canning, because of unstable high quality of packing of fresh pea.
 ',  ' The average size of exported peas during the first five years of the study period (1996-2001) was 60 tons. This figure has significantly grown to an average of 531 tons during the last four years of the study period (2002-2005). Similarly, the average magnitude of imported canned pea has grown from an average of 16 tons during the first five years of the study period to an average of 2,053 tons in the last four years.', ' Peas are delivered from the field in trucks. The peas are fed in to an electrically driven conveyor system that washes, removes vines and leaves, removes ends and cuts the peas and sorts them by diameter. About ten percent of the water used in this process is lost to spray and splashes. One quarter of the mass of the peas is removed in this process and sent to a dairy as feed.
Water packed in the canned peas is not chlorinated. Prior to filling, the peas are weighed. When there is a direct filling undergoing a salting process in order to preserve the freshness of the raw materials. Before seaming, each must be weighed to prevent shortage of weight. Then the blanching is performed (Blanching means rapidly heating peas to denatures the enzymes contribute to loss of color). It is performed using boiling of water or steam, either in rotating drums or in drench baskets. Then after testing of cans for leakage, cooling of cans inside the cooling tank, the material is ready for dispatch. The technological process has no any adverse environmental impact.', ' ', ' ', ' ' , '6 ' , ' 1'),
( ' Peanut butter', ' Peanut butter is a yellowish brown butter like product made from grounds nuts or peanuts. It is essentially made from cleaned, graded, blanched, roasted and crushed groundnuts containing about 55% oil and 25% proteins. Peanut butter is a highly nutritive food containing proteins, fat, carbohydrates as major constituents. It also contains calcium, phosphorous, iron, vitamin A, B1 and B2, etc. The calorific value of peanut butter is about 600. Peanut butter is used in the preparation of sandwiches, candy, bakery products, insecticidal formulation (to attract insects/pests), etc.',  'The Amhara Region especially the western and northwestern part is suitable for the production of groundnuts or peanuts. However, up to now, no large scale or commercial farming of peanuts has been undertaken. Even now, peanut crop is being produced by small-scale farmers. Like any other product, peanut brings more prices to its producers when it is further processed and converted to products like peanut butter. The peanut produced in the region is transported to Addis Ababa to be sold either in raw form or to be processed. Though the price of a peanut of quintal in the growing areas is relatively high compared to the prices of other crops, it is much lower than its price in Addis Ababa. If a plant is established in the Region for processing peanut, it will bring more financial resources to the Region. In other words through further processing there will be more value added for the product before it leaves the Region i.e. the product will bring more income. ', 'Despite its high nutrition value and the possibility of local production, the consumption of peanut butter is so far limited to urban residents only some factors restrict the consumption of peanut butter in rural areas. First, peanut butter is usually consumed with bread prepared in bakeries. People are not used to use the butter with injera, or any other type of staple diet used in the countryside. Second, in spite of the availability of peanuts in many rural areas, the crop is not usually converted to butter for local use. Third, rural people are not very much aware about the nutrition value of the crop. Finally, the crop is a cash crop which is readily sold in local markets instead of being consumed by the producers.
Even in urban areas, the consumption of peasant butter is limited to high income groups due to the high prices of the product. Currently a jar of local peanut butter which is about 500gms is sold for Birr 9.00 which discourages many potential consumers. In addition, the distribution of the product is limited to few so-called supper markets which cater to the need of foreigners and few nationals of high income. Had it not been for its high price, peanut butter is a popular food item. Children like it very much; so much so three children could easily eat one whole jar of peanut butter with bread during two or three meals.
Much of the peanut butter supplied to the market is imported. It is only in the last five years that peanut butter has started to be produced by cottage industries; and the share of the locally produced peanut butter in the market is very small. But if the product is produced in a modern factory which will improve its quality and possibly reduce its unit price, the demand potential is indeed high. Even with the current consumption level, the demand for peanut butter is projected to be 856 tons in 2006 and this demand is expected to grow by 5 percent every year. Current production of the butter is probably not more than 100 tons. This indicates that there is sufficient market for the product in the country; and the market will expand as more people start consuming the product. Since the Amhara Region has the natural potential to produce peanuts, it is natural that the region should process the peanuts to butter. There is also a good potential to export the product. ', ' Western and northwestern part of the Amhara Region.', ' Production of peanut butter involves the following operations:
The peanut seeds are shelled in a decorticating machine
The shelled peanuts are heated to an internal temperature of about 1550C to obtain the proper roasted flavor.
The influence of roasting time on sensory attributes and chemical measurements of flavor or components are examined.
Roasted peanuts undergo blanching to remove the skin of the seed
A coarse or medium grind is made, the ingredients are added and blended,
The oil level is controlled at 3% by keeping the mix at low temperature
Final grind is prepared at an appropriate temperature to produce the desired texture of smooth creamy paste,
Air is removed by vacuum and the mixture is cooled, and
The peanut butter is packed by using a vacuum fill type packing unit.
The premises under which peanut butter is manufactured/processed, packed and stored and distributed and all the equipment and tools used during processing should be maintained under strict hygienic conditions. Workers should have the highest standard of personal cleanliness.
Machinery and equipment needed include decorticating machine, roaster with thermostat, blanching equipment, coarse grinding machine, paste grinding and mixing machine, packing unit (vacuum fill type) and miscellaneous testing equipment, tanks, tools, etc.', 'Saves foreign exchange, stimulates local production of peanuts, increases the income of producers, introduces new technology and skills.

( ' Pickling', ' Pickling is the preservation of food items in common salt or vinegar. Spices and oil are added to make the food tasteful. Pickles are good appetizers and add to the palatability of a meal. Pickles aid digestion by stimulating the flow of gastric juices Rapeseed oil, sesame oil, mustard oil, lime juice, vinegar etc are used for pickling. Some spices such as bay leaves, cardamom, chilliest, cinnamon, clove, coriander, dill herb, ginger, mace, mustard, black paper, garlic, etc. are added to the process of pickling. Some examples of pickles are cucumber pickle, turnip pickle, lime pickle, red chilies pickle, mango pickle, apple pickle, etc',  'Pickling is one method of food preservation which is essential for maintaining the nutrition value of many types of crops, fruits and vegetables for a considerable length of time. Many perishable farm products are preserved for future consumption using. Pickling technology. Ethiopia being an agricultural country has many types of farm. Products which can be pickled to prevent physical and chemical deterioration and prolong the “shelf” life of these products. These will save many perishable products from being sold at much depressed prices at harvest time. The lack of technology to preserve perishable agricultural products in the country has discouraged farmers from producing these perishable products thus denying consumers the benefits of consuming these products in post harvest seasons and producers of saving them for better prices also in post- harvest seasons. All these problems point to the need of establishing pickling plants in the country for the benefit of both the producer and consumers. ', ' There is no a single pickling plant in the whole country let alone in the Amhara Region. Hence whatever latent market there is for pickled products, is not yet exploited. Without going into any market research but by simply considering the size of the population of the country, one can easily conclude that there is a sufficient demand for pickled products in the country. The Amhara Region can take the advantage of this situation by establishing the first pickling factory in the country', 'The raw materials for pickling are farm products mainly fruits and vegetables, salt vinegar, sugar, spices and water. All these will be obtained from domestic sources. ', ' Pickling is done in two stages:- fermentation or salting, and finishing and packing. Fermentation or curing is done either with dry salting or in brine. In dry salting method, the vegetable is treated with dry salt. The salt extracts the juice from the vegetable and forms the brine which is fermented by lactic acid forming bacteria. Fermentation in brine is soaking of the vegetable in a salt solution by predetermined concentration for a certain length of time. This treatment is given only to vegetables like cucumbers which do not contain enough juice to form brine with dry salt. Pickled products should be packed into bottles or jars loosely so as not to damage the shape and appearance of the pieces. Fresh vinegar is then added to fill up the spaces between the pieces. The jars or bottles are then allowed to stand for a while with the lid loosely on, covered again with more vinegar, if necessary, sealed air tight. Required machinery and tools include. Reformer, flanger, seamer and can testing gauge with different chucks and attachments; pressure cooker (retort); cap sealer portable; jar washing machine, cutting and peeling knives, fruits and vegetable washing tanks; preparation tables with aluminum top and benders; utensils, trays, etc. of different sizes and shapes; glass carboy and plastic vats, weighing balance, etc.', 'Stimulates production of fruits and vegetables suitable for pickling, saves foreign exchange, promotes self-sufficiency, introduces new skills and technology, and improves income of producers.

( ' Potato', ' Potatoes can be converted into chips, wafers, flour starch, alcohol and canned potatoes.  Potato chips are made plain or flavored and they may be sliced, plain or regular as well as wavy or wafer cut.  Potato wafers are chips which are deep fried in vegetable oils.  Both potato chips and wafers are becoming more and more popular in the big urban areas of the country.',  ' Potatoes are one of those perishable agricultural products which are by nature difficult to store and keep them for months even weeks.  After harvest, potatoes either have to be consumed by the producer or sold for immediate consumption by the buyer.  Due to their perishablity potatoes have to be sold immediately after harvesting which results in excess supply over demand depressing the price of potatoes.  This discourages farmers from growing potato which has relatively higher yield per hectare.  One option to solve this problem is to convert fresh potato is into dry or fried (chips and wafers) potato so that it can be sold during any time of the year with better prices.  This is why this project should be promoted.', ' Potato chips and wafers are new types of food whose consumption is increasing in the big urban centers.  With appropriate marketing promotion, the demand of these food products will increase in the future.  Strangely enough while potato is produced in all the highland parts of the country, most of the potato chips and wafers being consumed are imported.  One can see imported packets of chips and wafers in the “super” markets of Addis Ababa.  If we can produce potatoes, there is no reason why we can not process the fresh potato and change it to chips and wafers.  The existing market which will expand in the future will absorb the production of one or two potato chips and wafers producing plants.', ' All the “Dega” and upper “Woina Dega” parts of the Amhara region are sources of raw material-potato.

( ' Poultry feed', 'Poultry feed is a type of feed especially formulated and prepared for chickens. It is made form oil cakes, molasses, frushka, maize or other cereals, limestone, salt, etc. The feed is to be used by modern and traditional poultry growers. ',  ' Despite large flocks of poultry birds found throughout the country, poultry is the least modernized and commercialized agricultural activities. Due to its low level of commercialization, the economic benefit of this sub-sector has been very low both to the farmer and the national economy. Among other factors, the main cause for the low performance of the sub-sector is the lack of proper feed for the birds in rural and urban areas. It is common knowledge that chicken are the most neglected domestic animals in rural Ethiopia which results in low production of eggs and poultry meat. If properly feed and taken care of, chickens are the most productive among domestic animals. Which type of domestic animal gives birth/hatches 15-20 children/chickens in one production cycle? It is none other than the female poultry bird. With this multiplying capacity, the bird could have benefited its owner if provided with enough feed and proper husbandry. For the poultry sub-sector to contribute more income to owners and to the economy, feed must be produced and distributed to urban and rural areas.', ' According to the results of the “Ethiopian Agricultural Sample Enumeration” of 2000/02, the poultry population of the country was about 53 million of which 11.1 million were egg-laying hens. The share of the Amhara Region was 13 million and 3.3 million respectively. The Poultry Development Enterprise supplies 115 gm. of feed for each of its birds for each day. Annual feed requirement for each bird is, therefore, 52kgs. If properly fed, the food requirement of all the poultry birds of the country 1.81 million tons per year. (This assumes that all types of birds will consume the same quantity of food). Estimated annual feed consumption of poultry in the Amhara Region is about 0.55 million tons. Of the total poultry population about 1.99 million (5.6%) are in urban areas. The feed requirement of the urban poultry population is 85000 tons = (1.99 mill. x 52k.g).  If we assume that at least 60 percent of poultry if we assume that at least 60 percent of poultry birds in urban areas are provided with proper feed, annual requirement will be 58800 tons.

( ' Pulses', ' Beans, peas and lentils belong to the genus of legumes. These crops are also known as pulses. In many countries great importance is attached to pulses for human consumption especially with a view to their richness in protein. The aim of industrial processing of pulses is to prepare the agricultural produce for human consumption that is promoting perfectly hygienic products of attractive appearance to market requirements, keeping a constantly high quality standard. The processed pulses are either sold to consumers or delivered to the food industry for further processing to produce tinned foods or any other refined ready-made meals. Processing of pulses also helps to store the material to be sold in post harvest season. It is also used to maintain food reserve for period of food shortages.' , ' ',  ' Processing of pulses is not only a commercial operation for making financial gains, but it is also an operation that will lessen problems during times of food shortages. Hence, the need for processing pulses should not be seen only as a commercial venture. It should also be considered as a means for preventing human suffering during periods of in adequate food production. ', 'Enough pulses will be secured within the region for supplying the needed “raw materials’ for the processing plant. ', 'The processing of pulses involves about five stages depending on the type of seed to be processed. These are cleaning and grading, hulling (with out/with splitting), glazing and/or polishing, grinding and screening and hydrothermal treatment, Cleaning and grading include operations like removal of foreign matters, elimination of damaged discolored, broken, spoilt or infested seeds, removal of dirt sticking to the seed surface, classification by sizing to obtain a uniform end product. Hulling operation involves removing the indigestible coat from the seeds. During this operation, peas and lentils are often split or divided in to two halves. Glazing and polishing pulses are often exposed to an after treatment to improve their appearance and storage stability. Hulled and split peas and lentils are dampened and guided to pass through a rotating glazing drum after adding a glucose solution. Thereafter all sticky split halves are sorted out in the drum grader and subsequently separated again by using the splitter. Grinding and screening involve grinding and sifting the semi-processed peas and lentils using hammer or fine-grinding mills and plansifters for producing flour. Hydrothermal treatment represents a treatment with moisture and heat over a specific period, which allows the manufacture of special and easy-to-prepare food. Whole peas and lentils are soaked in water for 5 to 15 hours depending on the species, thus increasing their water content to about 55 percent. Then they are fed into autoclaves to be cooked to the stage of “well done”. The precooked pulses are then passed through a recycled- air drier for drying at low temperature.

( ' Starch derivative', 'Starch is extracted from maize, millet, wheat, rice, potatoes, or from roots such as manioc, tapioca, cassava yucca, etc. Further processing of starch produces starch derivatives such as glucose syrup, special glucose syrups and dextrose syrup. Dextrose monohydrate, dextrose anhydride, total sugar, high fructose syrup and sorbitol are extracted from dextrose syrup. Glucose syrup is used in the food industry not only because of its sweetness and nutritive value; but in particular for its functional properties which include moisture stabilization, softening ability, build-up of texture, prevention of crystallization of other sugars, formation of film and body. Glucose syrup is mainly used for sweets and confectionery, ice cream, pastries, preserves, and liqueurs. The syrup is a sweet, colorless, highly concentrated solution of a mixture of easily digestible sugars. Special glucose syrups like maltose syrup and high - DE (Dextrose Equivalent) glucose syrups are one group of refined starch derivatives.

Production of soft drinks which is another major user of the derivatives was 1,052,000 hecto liters during the same year. These two groups of beverage products alone consume large quantities of starch derivatives every year. The consumption of starch derivatives by the various industries taken together could justify the establishment of a starch derivatives producing factory. This is more so in view of the fact that all the raw materials to produce refined starch are available in the country. The Amhara Region is a major growing area for most of the crops from which starch is produced.', ' Maize, millet, wheat, rice, potatoes, etc from which starch is made are produced in the Amhara region.', ' For producing starch derivatives from refined starch, three types of production processes are employed for glucose syrup, for special glucose syrup and for dextrose syrup. Processing stages involved in the production of glucose syrup are acidification (treating starch slurry with acid), conversion (converting the acidified starch at high temperature into a mixture of glucose, maltose and higher saccharidies), refining and evaporation. Extraction of special glucose syrups is done through liquefaction, saccharification and evaporation. Dextrose syrup is laso produced (extracted from refined starch) through the process of liquefaction, saccharification, refining and evaporation. Starch liquefaction proceeds in two stages in the presence of thermostable alpha-amylase. In this case, part of the enzymes is added to the starch milk and the starch is preliquefied in a steam heated converter. Liquefaction then proceeds in a rentention zone at a temperature of 95oC for a period of 90 to 120 minutes. Saccharification is done in the presence of amyloglucosidas. It is a slow process which takes about 58 to 62 hours. This is followed by multi-stage purification process. Productions of the three major starch derivatives require different sets of machinery and equipment. For example machinery and equipment for producing glucose syrup include starch mill tank, continuous acidification, batch acidification, acidified starch milk tank, heat exchanger, continuous converter, flash cooling, hot water aggregate, neutralization tank, filter, tanks, evaporator and product tank.', 'Similar to other projects.

Some of the old beer factories have been also expanded to increase production. Due to the establishment of the new factories and the expansion of the old ones, demand for pilfer proof bottle caps has increased. Around 1994, the demand for the caps was estimated to be about 13 million pieces; and projected demand in 2007 is about 18 million. The Amhara Region has two large beer factories which meet the major portion of the demand for beer in the country. In addition, there are two soft drinks and about three "mineral" water bottling plants in the Region. These factories together consume more than 5.5 million pieces of pilfer proof bottle caps in a year. As these factories expand and as new factories are established the demand for the caps will grow.

( 'Rural Household Hand Tools ', ' Products considered in this project idea are simple hand tools used by rural households for a variety of tasks including agricultural activities. These tools include picks, axes, sickles, shovels, machetes, etc. The tools are used on farms and around houses.', ' Due to our low level of development in manufacturing, transport, construction, trade and commerce, finance and other service sectors, more than 85 percent of the people of Ethiopia live in rural areas deriving their livelihood from traditional agriculture which depends much on human labor and animal power. This situation requires the extensive use of hand tools to perform different tasks at home and on farms by millions of rural family members. For example, axes and sickles are essential hand tools for any rural family. Every family has to have at least two sickles and one ax to meet the family requirement for accomplishing various tasks on farms and around the houses. There is also a need for the other hand tools.Even though there is one factory that produces sickles, shovels and spades, the bulk of the country’s demand for hand tools is met by imports. For example the sickle market is flooded by imports. Other hand tools are also supplied from imports. Since hand tools for rural households are part of agricultural implements and tools, they have an impact on agricultural production and rural reconstruction. As such these tools should be produced at home as much as it is economical.', ' In 2006, there are about 12.8 million families living in the rural areas of Ethiopia. Of these, 3.3 million families are in the Amhara region. As mentioned above, rural hand tools are needed by each rural family. For example, in the Amhara Region the demand for sickles is about 6.6 million, 3.3 million for axes, and similar numbers for other types of hand tools. Most rural households have the hand tools needed for their farm activities either from imports or domestic production. As domestic production is very small, most of the hand tools especially sickles in the hands of farmers are from imports. The future demand for these tools is, therefore, composed of replacement and new requirement by young rural families. A market study for rural hand tools indicated that in 2006, the demand will be about 434,000 and the share of the Amhara Region is about 130,000.

', ' ', 'In the Amhara Region the traditional storage system for grains is the use of large or small pots made from mud, barns made form wood or underground pits. The mud pots do not usually contain large volume of grains and they do not last long. Barns made from wood and plastered with mud are kept outside the houses and as such are liable to be infested by rodents with a substantial loss of grain every year. Underground pits are used in the highland areas of the region usually used for storing barley. These pits are usually flooded with water during the rainy season, and the loss of grain is quite large. It has been said many times that more than 25 percent of the country’s grains production is lost/wasted every year due to the traditional storage system practiced by farmers. This huge annual loss of grains can be substantially reduced if steel storage bins are used. In addition, due to shortages of wood because of wide spread deforestation in the Region, it has become almost impossible to construct grain stores from wood. Mud posts can not be used for storing grains which are more than 5 quintals as their structure are weak to withstand load.
Of the 3.6 million farming families living in the Amhara Region, at least some “well-to-do” families might be interested in using steel storage bins instead of the traditional storage facilities. If we assume that for the initial phase at least 3 percent of the farming families will use steel storage bins, total initial demand for the bins will be 108,000 units and this conservative demand estimate is more than the production capacities of a number of plants which produce steel storage bins. ', 'Steel sheets or galvanized iron sheets is the main input for producing steel storage bins. Either of the inputs will be imported. ', 'The sheet is first cut to the required size. It is then rolled to cylindrical shape and the ends are seamed. Circular sheets are cut and fixed to the cylindrical section of the bin and later the lid is fixed.

Various products like oils, processed fruits, various milk products, biscuits, talcum powder, etc, are packed in tin containers.  These are some basic advantages of using tin containers.  These are:- saving space by putting the cans on top of the other, can be reused, have better guarantee against seepage, can withstand high temperature unlike plastic containers. ', ' There is only one factory i.e. Ethiopian Crown Cork which produce tin can containers.  Some tin cans (container) using factories have small tin can making units attached to the main factory.  Apart from this, there are no factories that produce tin can for the various industries which use tin cans for packing their products.  Such factories include the paints factories, the fruits and vegetable processing and canning plants, fish and meat canning factories, and other assorted industries.  As industry develops in the country, more tin can using factories will be built.  This will require additional tin cans for packing purposes.  This implies that more tin can producing plants should be established in the country.  In the Amhara Region, there are two meat and fishing canning factories.  Other tin can using factories are to be established in the Region in the near feature.  For the existing industries as well as for those to be established, there will be increasing demand for tin cans.  And there will be a need to establish a tin can container producing plant in the Region.', ' The tin can requirements of the food processing industries are met by imports, while domestic factories supply tin cans to the paints and varnish factories.  Between 1987 and 1988, average annual production of tin cans was 1.8 million pieces.  No additional capacity has been created since then while the demand for tin can is increasing.  During the last ten years, more capacity has been created in the production of paints and varnishes; this in turn creates additional demand for tin cans.

As their name imply, these tools are manually operated.  This project ideas is about producing screw drivers, hammers and spanners.  Spanners are gripping and adjusting type of hand tools.  Spanners or wrenches of various designs are used for bolt-fastening (tightening and loosening) operations.  Screw drivers are used to drive the slitted head of screws.

( ' Water Filter Containers', ' Water filter containers are component parts of domestic water filters used for treating water to make it free from undesirable impurities and harmful bacteria that may cause water borne diseases. The containers for the water filter can be made from locally available clay material (burnt clay containers) aluminum or stainless steel. As compared to other types of containers, stainless steel filter containers have much more popularity because they are more durable and attractive. Water filter containers are used together with water filter candles for treating drinking water.', 'In more developed countries where there is more awareness about health and other qualities of life, the use of water filters is an absolute necessity. Every household has at least one water filter apparatus for filtering drinking water. The apparatus is as essential as an oven which is used for cooking food. In least developed countries such as ours, where there are problems in the quality of water which comes from tapped and untapped sources and where the use of water filters is very scarce, millions of people suffer from water borne diseases. The irony about this problem is those water filters are simple apparatus which can easily be made by local craftsmen and which can be acquired by paying reasonable prices. The main obstacle is that the lack of awareness by the majority of rural people about the benefits of using water filters. However, with public campaign about the health benefits, people will be readily willing to use water filters. Hence, by recognizing the need of using water filters, the Region should promote and facilitate the establishment of a plant which will produce water filters. ', 'so far the main consumers of water filters are hospitals, laboratories and some high standard hotels and restaurants. Compared to the total population of the country, household purchase and use of water filters are extremely small. Consequently the quantities of water filter imported every year are relatively small. For example, between 1986 and 1996, average animal import of water filter was 1075 units; and the import has been increasing at an average rate of 14 percent per year. The projected demand for 2007 will be about 25000 units. This demand is more than the production capacity of medium scale plant which can be established in the Amhara Region whose share of projected demand will be close to 7000 units. The projection was made with the assumption that only 2 percent of urban households will use water filters. This is a very conservative assumption. Given the health benefits that water filters give to consumers, one could have assumed more than 2 percent which could have increased the projected demand. ', ' The major raw materials are stainless steel sheet and polishing compound; and these will be imported.', ' The process of manufacturing water filter containers requires practical knowledge. Stainless steel circles are pressed in double action power press to the required size and shape. If the hard steel circles are used, they are first annealed, then pressed and finally spun on spinning lathe for proper shaping of the item.

You find weights in every shop and kiosk selling different types of merchandize and also in jewelry houses.  The standard weights in shops and kiosks are of 5 kgs, one kg, 500gms, 100gms, and 50gms. ', ' If one visualizes the number of shops and kiosks in the country, it is easy to imagine the number of weights under use in the country.  All these weights are imported.  Weights are made from ferrous or non-ferrous metals either by casting, forging or machining.  These are simple operations but still we do not produce the weights we use.  Like so many other products, it is time we start producing these simple objects and stop importing them.  Investors in the Amhara region can take this opportunity and produce weights not only to the Region but also to the other parts of the country. ', 'If strict control is undertaken by the Standards Agency, probably more than 50 percent of weights being used in the country would be disqualified for incorrect (usually for being under weight) measurement.  A casual observation of weights in any shop reveals that most of the weights are chiseled to reduce their weights.  So a weight which weighs 1kg originally when it was produced now weighs probably 800 or 700 gms.  When this widespread problem is considered, it is safe to assume that at least 50 percent of the existing weights need replacement which generates a large demand for weights for replacement.  In addition, other weights will be needed for new shops and kiosks to be opened throughout the country.  This indicates that the demand for weights will be large enough to absorb the production volume of a medium size plant. ', ' The ferrous or non-ferrous metals from which weights are made will be imported.', 'The non-ferrous weights are of the cast bronze.  The bronze may be either of phosphorous bronze, copper and its alloys.  The construction of the weights is solid type, having normally pentagon, and hexagonal shapes, flattened at the top and bottom faces.  Weights can be manufactured with either of the following processes by casting, forging or machining.  In the casting process, the weights are cast by the usual casting procedure to give the weights some symmetrical and definite shapes.  Normally cast weights do not require machining, but they are cleaned on the surfaces and painted black.  The forging process is simpler and cheaper than the casting process but the initial cost of machining is high.  This requires power and steam hammers and their accessories.  Small weights, particularly non-ferrous and below 200gms can be obtained from bright hexagonal or pentagon shaped bars, duly cut into pieces.  Machinery needed include small cupola, small alloying furnace, molding boxes and tools, patterns, power press.

The three hand tools improve the productivity of labor in construction works.', ' Like most other construction hand tools, the Amhara Region imports wheel barrows from other parts of the country of from abroad.  But if the Region has to accelerate its social and economic development, it has to be self- sufficient in the production of basic construction hand tools like wheel barrow.

In this situation, to save the remaining forest resources of the Region, and not to further aggravate the soil erosion problem of the Region, the use of kerosene through wick stove is one option for generating fuel for cooking and heating.  The relative advantage of using kerosene instead of fuel wood and charcoal will depend on the relative pries of the two sources of energy.

But there are no facilities at the site where tourists gather to watch/see the fall. Usually most tourists arrive at the fall around 10-12 a.m in the morning when it is hot at the site. While watching the cascading of the water in the fall, they need drinks, shelter from the hot sun and sometime snack. But unfortunately there are no facilities to provide these services. If there were hotels and restaurants, many tourists could have made overnight stay near the fall. They would have preferred to watch the fall at sunset or sunrise. They could have wanted to hear the sound of the Falls during the night. They could have experienced what it feels during the night in rural Ethiopia where there are no noises of urban life. In short, they could have preferred to stay near the fall watching its huge water flow for sometime say a night, a day or more. But there is nothing there to make them stay.

In physical fitness centers, there can be also steam and sauna baths, table tennis and ground tennis games. Other additional services can also be given to customers. ' ,

' Physical fitness centers and gymnasiums do not require large investment, but their benefits are next to services rendered by health care facilities. In fact in many countries, physical fitness centers and gymnasiums are built and provided by the state. In other countries these centers are provided both by the state and the private sector. At any rate, physical fitness centers and gymnasiums are available in large numbers in developed countries. In fact many residential houses in developed countries have their own physical fitness facilities. This is in addition to the many gymnasiums and physical fitness centers scattered throughout residential neighborhoods. However, in developing countries physical fitness centers are very rare and they are used by a small number of people. For example, Addis Ababa, the capital of the third populous country in Africa and which has more than 3 million inhabitants has only four or five gymnasiums and physical fitness centers. Building and equipping a physical fitness center does not cost more than the price of a 4-wheel Drive vehicle. But this very useful facility is not available even in the major urban centers of the country. The Amhara Region, like all other regions of the country, does not have any physical fitness centers. To promote the physical well- being of the people at least of those who live in urban urban areas, there is a need to establish physical fitness centers in all major towns of the Region. ',
' About 2.3 million people live in urban areas in the Amhara Region. If we assume that at least 20 percent of the urban population will use the services of physical fitness centers and gymnasiums, total number of users will be 460,000. This number of potential users will be spread across the different urban centers of the Region. Intuitively, one can say with some degree of certainty that there is enough market for physical fitness services in the zonal capitals of the Region. ',

The parks are protected by law from encroachment by people and domestic animals In kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and other southern and eastern African countries there are huge tracts of land where wild animals roam in thousands. The purpose of this project idea is, therefore, to establish game reserves or wild life parks in appropriate localities in the Amhara Region.   ',
' ',
' up to the first quarter of the last century, many parts of the now Amhara Region especially the lowlands(along river valleys) and the areas along the Sudan boarder were sanctuaries of many types of wild animals mostly large mammals. With population increase and further deforestation, most of those wild animal sanctuaries in the low land areas were converted to livestock grazing areas or farms. As a result the wild animals except the monkeys and apes were decimated through uncontrolled hunting, lack of shelter and lack of food especially in the low land areas of the region. In the boarder areas, there were large numbers of wild animals until the 1960s and 70s. But their number was decreasing for reasons mentioned above. Today, there are few animals like lion, elephants and some. others along the Ethio-Sudan boarders. If certain areas along the boarder are reserved for wild animals, the remaining wild animals will migrate to these protected areas. In a short period of time their number will increase to make the protected areas a wild life reserve or park. This is how the wild life parks in other parts of the country were established and developed. Once new parks are established in suitable areas in the Amhara Region, the development of other infrastructures such as access roads, lodges and restaurants will follow. Currently tourists come to the Region mainly to visit our religious, historical and natural heritage. The establishments of wild life parks in the Region will make tourists stay more in the region and will also attract additional tourists who are interested in wild life. ',
' A survey has to be undertaken to determine which localities in the Region have the highest potential of becoming wild life parks. Main criteria for the first phase evaluation will be the presence of wild life (animals) in the area, absence of human settlement and agricultural activities around the potential areas. Once these areas are identified, additional criteria will be developed to select one or two sites where wild life parks will be developed. The development of the sites will entail the protection of the sites from human interference, provision of adequate water and food supplies within the parks establishing observation center in the sites, if necessary bringing in some wild animals from other areas of similar climatic conditions.

These conferences and meetings will bring money to the cities where they are held. Conference participants, media people, security personnel and others will spend money in the cities for different purposes Money is paid for hotel accommodations, restaurants, transport service providers, shops, etc. The income that conferences, conventions workshops, and other gatherings generate to a city expands economic and social activities in  that particular city. This creates employment, increases income of the people. It is because of such and similar benefits that many cities in developed and developing countries build large convention/conference centers and encourage investors to establish standard hotels and restaurants.

At the same time, hotels for tourists have to be relatively small perhaps in the range of 15 to 20 beds since tourists come in groups of not more than 20 people in a group Foreign tourists who travel to Africa come with certain pre-conceived prejudices about the standards of hotels and restaurants. These prejudices can only be disproved if these hotels and restaurants are always clean and neat to the highest standard. Otherwise, tourists will be discouraged from visiting tourist sites in the Region. Hence one pre-condition for the further development of the tourist industry in the Amhara Region is the presence of hotels and restaurants with the highest standard of cleanliness and neatness.

It is not unusual where a cleaner becomes a cook after a certain period of cleaning in the kitchen of a certain hotel or restaurant in the region. Probably this is not unique for the Region. It happens also in other regions. But the level of hotel and restaurants services in the Region is, admittedly, much below the standard of some other Regions. This is especially true in the western parts of the Region. There could be many reasons and causes for the poor food and service provided by hotels and restaurants of the Region. There is no need to mention all these reasons and causes, The end result is that there is a strong need to give training in food preparation, hotel and restaurant services for practically and workers of hotels and restaurants operating in the Amhara Region.

As a result these urban centers have developed a culture better suited to the relatively efficient management of hotels, restaurants and other catering enterprises. On the other hand, urban areas in the Amhara Region have been late in their acquaintance to the management and administration of hotels, restaurants and other similar enterprises. As a result, there are many problems facing the operations of hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, etc. the main cause for these problems. is the fact that personnel at every level of hotel and restaurant management have not taken basic training in the management of these and similar enterprises. The end result of all this is that compared to other major regions, the services provided by hotels, restaurants, etc are relatively poor. This can be confirmed when one observes how hotel and restaurant management staff and personnel handle customer complaints, requests, and issues related with hotel hospitality and reception. Personnel are indifferent, negligent, in some cases rude, arrogant and in general inefficient. The whole operations of hotels and restaurants are bellow accepted standards. The level of cleanness and hygiene of utensils by which food and drinks are served, of bed rooms, toilets, eating and drinking halls, even the clothing and general appearance of workers is poor to say the least.

' As noted above, canvas shoes are popular among elementary and high school students.  In the Amhara region, in 2004, there were about 2.2 million elementary and high school students.  If we assume that at least 40 percent of these students use canvas shoes, annual demand of canvas shoes could be 880,000 pairs.  This potential market size is more than sufficient to make a canvas shoes making plant financially and technically viable.  ' , 

' Canvas shoes are mainly made from canvas and rubber sole.  The canvas can be obtained from some of the textile factories of the country.  The raw material of the rubber sole will be imported and the sole could be made in the plant. ',

' The main processing stages include cutting the canvas uppers of the shoes into various sizes and sewing them, preparing the rubber soles using injection moulds and joining the uppers and the soles by heating process.

('Leather Shoe Uppers',

'These are the upper parts or covers of shoes made from finished leather. With increasing specialization of all types of manufacturing activities, leather shoe upper are prepared separately and supplied to leather shoes manufacturing factories. Leather shoes factories in industrially advanced countries receive their shoe uppers from leather factories in developing countries. ',

'With the largest livestock population and the 2nd highest human population in Africa, Ethiopia has the highest potential to be the continent’s largest producer and consumer of leather goods. This potential can be translated into reality if the country improves its livestock quality and expands its leather and leather products industry. During the last twenty years, this industry has shown improvement in increasing its product mixes and in expanding its exports. Leather uppers are among the export items of the industry. With 16 percent of the total land mass of the country, the Amhara Region has close to 30 percent of the livestock resources of the country. But the Region does not have leather industries which matches its resources. In the world division of labor, processing hides and skins close to the finishing stage including shoe uppers is left to the developing countries. In this scheme of things, the Amhara Region, being one of the centers of livestock resources, should position itself to produce leather products like shoe uppers. The products have markets both at home and abroad. If the region has about 30 percent of the countries livestock resources, should it not produce, at least, 30 percent of the leather products of the country? ',

'The plant could be an integrated plant where it starts processing raw hides and skins and produces finished leather including shoe uppers. Hence the raw materials, hides and skins, will come within the region. ',
' The first step is the cutting of leather according to the designs supplied by the customer (shoe manufacturer) with the help of patterns on clicking press. Similarly lining component of suitable material is also cut. The upper components are skived and folded according to the design and lining as joined with it using suitable joining solutions. Then follow the stitching on various types of machines, eyeleting and cleaning. The finished uppers are then brushed and packed for sale. Main machinery required includes pattern shearing machine, grading pantograph, clicking press, stamping machine, flat, post and cylinder bed sewing machine, upper folding and brushing machine, miscellaneous machines and tools, etc. ',

'Practically all goods made from leather have linings and these linings are also made from leather. Hence the demand for lining leather increases with the demand for leather goods especially leather shoes. The potential of the Amhara region with regard to the development of the leather industry is briefly stated in another project idea within the industry. In short, the region has the raw material base to develop leather based industries for the regional, national and international markets. ', 
'Goat and sheep skins are the raw materials for producing lining leather and these could be obtained within the region ',
' Goat and sheep skins to be finished into lining leather are soaked in water containing one percent of Syndet or Idet 10. these are then washed and bleached in a solution containing required amount of oxalic acid, calagon and basyntan for half an hour washed with running water and hosed up to remove excess water. This is followed by retaining for two hours in drums containing water and about 15 gallon myroband hosing up the material for overnight. Excess of tanning matter is removed by washing and the material is fat liquored at about 450c. The fat solution is made from 31 percent Turkey red oil, one percent castor oil, two to four percent china clay and 150 percent water based on the weight of the material. The material is then rammed dried, raw dusted, staked, toggled, dried, buffed and softened in drum. Next is the seasoning of the skins.

'With the largest livestock population in Africa, one could have expected Ethiopia to have thriving leather goods industries which supply domestic and foreign markets. But there is only one leather goods making factory in the country; and this was built to supply to foreign markets through an arrangement with a European marketing firm. Some of the products of the factory are sold in Addis Ababa in one or two shops. Apart from this, there are no supplies of leather goods in the country. the demand for leather goods is limited due to high prices of the products and the low purchasing power of the majority of the population. However, there is a section of the population which has the financial ability to buy leather goods like ladies’ bags, wallets, belts small briefcases. Of the 20 million people in the urban areas of the Amhara Region, at least 0.05 percent can afford to buy some type of leather goods. This will translate in to 100,000 potential customers. if we assume that one potential customer will buy one piece of leather goods per year, 100,000 units of leather (the majority of which will be ladies bags) goods will be sold every years. Even if half of this becomes actual demand, it will make a leather goods making factory finically viable.   ',
'The main inputs will be printed or plain chrome leather, cloth lining, stud, thread, rivets, buckles, pins, nails, flour, dyes, etc. The main inputs will be secured from domestic sources; others will be imported. ',

('Reinforcement Iron Bars Making Plant',

'  A combination of cement, sand, aggregate and bars of deformed or round iron is the heart of the building and construction industry.  These materials combined together in certain proportion constitute the strength of all building and other construction works.  Buildings, bridges, dams and all kinds of light and heavy construction works require reinforcement bars.  The bars with concrete are reliable in carrying both static and dynamic loads. ',

'The production of cement, reinforcement iron bars, sheet glass and bricks are the foundation for the development of modern construction industry.  Most construction materials are bulky which make them expensive to transport long distances.  Thus in practically all cases, many types of construction materials like cement, iron bars, bricks are as far as possible produced in areas which are relatively close to their consumption centers.  The Amhara Region is one of the least constructed and built areas in the country.  In addition, basic construction materials such as cement, reinforcement bars, even bricks are not produced in the Region.  They are all imported from other parts of the country- on the average 600 km from the Region.  This makes these materials more expensive which hampers the expansion of building construction and civil engineering works- which the Region needs very desperately.  Reinforcement bars are made mainly from iron bars which are imported.  The plant which produces reinforcement bars can be located in any city where there is enough power.  At least to save transport cost and to have reliable supply of this essential construction material, there is a strong need to establish one reinforcement bars making plant in the Amhara Region. ',

' For a long time there was only one plant which was producing reinforcement bars.  Recently one plant was converted to produce reinforcement bars.  Between 1999 and 2004, average annual production of reinforcement bars was 6,845 tons; and during the same period about the same quantity might have been imported every year.  The two plants are located near Addis Ababa; and the imported bars are also distributed from Addis Ababa.  Similar to many parts of the country, construction is increasing in the Amhara Region.  The current construction volume alone can consume the production of a medium size reinforcement bars making plant. ',

'The raw materials are bellets and scrap iron.  Bellets are imported and scrap iron is collected within the country mostly in and around Addis Ababa.  Only bellets will be used in the new plant since scrap iron will not be found in the Region in sufficient quantity. ',

'The main process is to heat the bellets and making the heated bellets pass through a series of rolling mills whereby the bellets are elongated at each stage of rolling until they reach the desired thickness.  Finally the elongated bars are cut in to the desired length usually 4 meters each.  Main machineries include heating furnace, rough, intermediate and finishing mills. ',

'Building construction in many cities of the region is rapidly growing. People want to build condominium, high-rise buildings for apartment purpose.  Private firms construct offices, houses, stores and factory buildings all using steel profiles.  Presently there is no factory that produces steel profile in the region.  It is imported mainly from Addis Ababa and other regions.  The demand however, increases with the growth of building construction.  It is very essential to have a steel production plant in the region to satisfy the demand and create employment.  ',

All the products that such a factory produce and /or fabricate are imported from Addis Ababa.  Most of these products are bulky and take a lot of space to transport and as a result are expensive which is reflected in their expensive prices.  What was once dormant, the Amhara Region (at least in urban areas) is showing some signs of modernization, some signs of development and some signs of awakening.  These signs of modernization should be supported by the provision of the necessary inputs such as metal fabricated products and the way to provide these inputs is by promoting the establishment of a steel fabrication and ironwork factory.

All pad locks used in the region as well as in the country are imported.  Any casual observation of shops, any where in the country will reveal that pad locks displayed for sale are of foreign origin.  The technology of manufacturing pad locks is a simple and common technology; and this technology can easily be mastered by Ethiopian technicians and skilled laborers.  The investment needed for making pad locks is modest which is affordable by many national investors.  Given this, it is logical to propose the establishment of a pad lock manufacturing factory in the Amhara Region. ',

' Depending upon the size of the lock and the material from which it will be made, the production process takes the following main steps.  The body of the pad lock may be either casted or fabricated.  If the body is to be made from steel, it will be fabricated by steel plates, cut into shape in power press.  Usually there will be two plates of the same shape and size-one consisting of the top side and the other the bottom side.  The two parts are joined together and riveted.  Holes are made by piercing tools.  The levers are also manufactured on the power presses.  If the body is to be made from non- ferrous metals, it is normally cast in one piece.  The shakle is made from mild steel or hard steel rods, bent and flattened at ends.  Size of the lock, serial number, makers name, model, etc embossed after manufacturing.

' The use of metal doors and windows must be encouraged since this will save trees from being cut down for timber production- which further aggravates the process of deforestation in the Region.  It is better to conserve and develop our natural resources and generate foreign exchange that will substitute the use of our natural resources.  The use of metal doors and windows is one by which we save our natural resource-forests at the expense of spending foreign exchange for importing the metal input.  But the foreign exchange used to buy the metal could be generated by exporting products to be obtained from various natural resources.  In addition, metal doors and windows are stronger and last longer than wooden doors and windows. ',


' Any body who is familiar with the rural and urban housing situations in the Amhara Region can easily realize the magnitude of need of metal doors and windows in the whole Region.

These locks are generally made from brass to have long life and good appearance.  However, as brass becomes more expensive, the locks are also made from sheet metal.  Lately locks are made by casting zinc. ',
'One can easily imagine the number of cupboards and drawers there are in use in the country.  It is in the hundreds of thousands.  There are drawers and cupboards in homes, offices, hotels, hospitals, shops, factories, stores, etc.  If we take homes alone, we can roughly estimates the number of cupboards and drawers available in the urban areas of the country.  In 2006, there are about 2.4 million families living in the urban areas of the country.  Of these families, it is safe to assume that at least 40 percent of them have one cupboard and two drawers.  This translates into 960,000 cupboards and 1,920,000 drawers.  Usually one cupboard has two locks and one drawer has one lock.  Hence the number of cupboard locks is 1,920,000 and that drawer is 1,920,000 locks.  All these locks are imported.  It is common sense to think about exploiting this huge market by establishing a plant which will produce cupboard and drawer locks. ',

'Following the above argument, let us assume that at least 25 percent of the existing locks are replaced every year and new demand for locks grows by 3 percent per year.  Total annual demand for these locks will then be 1,075,200= (25%of 3,840,000+3% of 3,840,000).  Meeting this annual demand will be more than the production capacity of at least 5 small scale locks producing factories. ',

'The different parts of locks are all made from metals.  All these will be imported probably in ready-made of semi-finished form. ',

'The different components of locks i.e. body plate cover, plate belt; levers, keys etc. are sand casted with the help of patterns.  They keys are sometimes made of steel on a power press in die.  The casted parts of locks are filled to give the finish in die.  After filling the springs are fitted to levers and grooves are cut to fill in the key blank.  The different components are then assembled and the opening and closing of lock is checked for its smooth operation.  Required machinery include pit furnaces with electric blower, moulding, casting, filling and fitting tools, bench vices, hammers, chisels, belt sander and polishing machine, measuring tools. ',

(' Barbed Wire Making Plant',

'Barbed (sharpened) wire is a very effective means of providing security to a particular area.  It essentially consists of two or more steel wires which are fitted with small pieces of pointed barbs-hence the name barbed wire.  The steel wires are tightly twisted so that the barbs remain in a fixed position. ',

'Barbed wire are used as fences for various buildings and enclosures.  They are installed around factories, stores, vegetable and other commercial farms located near urban areas, dairy farms and other establishments which have properties susceptible to theft.  Barbed wires are used to keep away animals (wild or domestic) from destroying crops, fruits, vegetables, tress, hay, etc. and to protect such properties from theft and vandalism.  The alternative to the use of barbed wire is to build walls around properties or to build fences from wood poles.  Walls are expensive and wood poles cause deforestation.  In addition, wood poles have shorter service life.  So far the use of barbed wire in the Amhara Region is very rare.  It is only around some school compounds that barbed wires are used for fencing purposes.  Virtually all homes, barns, etc are fenced using wood poles and other dry branches of wood.  This has aggravated the problem of deforestation in the Region.  The use of barbed wire for fencing can be promoted for replacing the use of wood poles for the same purpose.  This is why this project idea is included for promotion by the Region. ',

'There is one small plant near Addis Ababa which produces barbed wire for the whole country; and this plant produces from 300-500 tons of barbed wire per year.  The barbed wire requirement of the Amhara Region is met by imports from Addis Ababa.  Barbed wire is one of those products which are inconvenient and expensive to transport.  Because of increasing economic activities in the Amhara Region the demand for barbed wire will increase in the future.  As land is becoming more and more the property of private individuals, more land will be enclosed by fences to (a) separate one piece of land from the other (b) protect properties on the land such as grass, trees, crops, (c) fruits & vegetables, livestock, etc. ',
'Steel wire will be imported until such a wire is produced in the country.  ',
'The barbs are first cut to the correct size and the barbs may either be made during the cutting process or sharpened later.  The steel were is taken from the roll directly and while the two strands are being twisted together, the pieces of sharpened wire or barbs are fitted into the wire.  They are then rolled and packed.  Main machines required include special purpose twisting machine, bench grinder, mechanical wire cutter, saws, hand tools, etc. ',

('Wire Gauge Making Plant',

'This is a wire net which is widely by builders and in a number of industries.  Wire nets are also used in soil conservation structures and also as retaining wall for holding mud slides along roads built on hilly areas. ',

'Among the uses that wire gauge or gabbion provides the most relevant for the Amhara Region is its uses in the prevention of soil erosion.  As we all know, the Region being mountainous in most parts is subject to severe soil erosion every year.  Due to lack of soil conservation measure, most of the soil resources of the Region are eroded and soil productivity has declined considerably in many parts of the Region.  Though expensive compared to other soil conservation measures, the use of gabbion is one effective way to protect and conserve the soil resources of the Region.  Gabbion is particularly effective to stop the formation of gullies or to control the widening of already formed gullies.  Besides, in the construction of roads, gabbion is used for constructing retaining walls to protect mud slide or the stride of stones towards the road which can cause the road to be blocked.  Given this, the establishment of a wire gauge making plant in the Region is necessary. ',

'The Amhara Region covers an area of 170,000 km2 of which more than 80 percent needs soil protection structures one of which is the use of gabion.  If situations had permitted 136,000 km2 of the Amhara Region should have been provided with soil conservation and protection measures.  If we assume only ten percent of this area is to use gabbion for soil conservation structures, total area will be 13,600 km2.  The quantity of gabion to be used for this area will be enormous.  When demand for other uses of wire gauge is added, the combined demand for wire gauge can easily absorb the production of a medium size wire gauge plant. ',

'Main raw material is wire which can be obtained from domestic factories. ',

'Although there are a number of different types of wire gauges such as honeycomb, diamond, woven wire and crimped wire, it is mostly the honeycomb which is widely used.  The netting is hexagonal and the mesh size may vary from ¼ inch to 2 inches.  Main processing stages include the following.  Wire of the correct gauge is fed from a wooden bobbin and is twisted together by a machine with another wire fed from a spiral coil rod.  The finished netting is coiled on to a roller for dispatch.  Main machinery required includes wire netting machine, special coil winding machine, bobbin winding machine, beaming carriage and lathe. ',

A drafting machine performs all the functions of set square, T-square, and parallel rule protractor. ',

' Drawing instruments used by students, draftsmen, engineers and other professionals come in different forms and sizes.  All the drawing instruments used throughout the country are imported.  Most of the instruments are made from plastics and some are made from metals.  It seems strange that at least some attempts have not been made to make some types of drafting instruments in the country.  A drafting machine is used in all technical schools, colleges, universities and in engineering offices of the country.  With the expansion of technical schools and colleges in the country, the demand for drafting machine is increasing every year.  It is time that the country starts producing at least some engineering design and mathematical instruments for domestic consumption.  Production of drafting machine is one that should be promoted to make the country self-sufficient in this important engineering tool. ',


' In 1996 E.C. there were more than 40,000 students in engineering related fields in the Technical and Vocational Education program of the country.  This figure will grow as more students from secondary schools join the program-which means the demand for drafting machines and other technical and engineering instruments will also increase.  In addition to the need of drafting machine by vocational students, there is also the demand for the product by engineering students of the country and by technical professionals who are engaged in design and drafting works.  All in all, annual demand for drafting machine may range between 60,000 to 80,000 per year.  This will justify the establishment of a plant which will make drafting machines. ',

(' Gabion Making Plant',

' Gabion is a large rectangular box of netted wire used in civil engineering works. Gabion has long been used as a transition method of construction and engineering for protecting river banks from erosion, for hardening the shoulder of roads and the face of slopes to prevent landslide. Gabion is also used for the foundation of water reservoirs. In the context of the Amhara Region, where there are serious problems of landslides gullies and in general soil erosion, gabion will be used for the protection and conservation of soil resources. Gabion is produced in a tabular or bed mattress (rectangular cube) type wire netting form. Stones have to be stuffed inside the gabion to make it useful. ',
' ',
' The demand for gabion comes from the need of protecting the soil resources of the Region. The loss of these resources through water erosion is huge. Every year the Amhara Region loses billions of tons of fertile soil due to erosion. The consequence of this resource loss has been the decline of food production which results in food shortages in most parts of the Region. There are many localities in the Region where it has become difficult to grow trees, and shrubs, even grass due to the extreme shallowness of the soil or complete lack of it. The use of gabion is one alternative means for protecting soils from erosion. Gabion mad from wire might cost more than some erosion control measures. As a result, it is used selectively and in areas where other erosion control measures are not effective. Relevant government agencies and many NGOs are involved in protecting and conserving our natural resources. These organizations use gabion for protecting the soil from erosion. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of gabion since local production is very low. Most of the gabion used in the country is imported. As there is a very strong and urgent need for conserving the soil resource of the Amhara Region; and as the size of land to be covered by soil conservation measures is more than 75 percent of the 170,000 sq.km of the Region, there will be large demand for gabion in the Amhara Region.

'Though the construction industry is expanding and growing at a rapid rate during the last ten years, many types of construction materials are imported. And metallic sanitary fittings are one of the groups of construction materials which are imported. Between 1980 and 1990 when imports were restricted by government policy, an annual average import of metallic fittings was about 269,000 kgs. The projected demand for these fittings in 2008 will be 2,895,000 kgs. Currently, there is a small plant with a production capacity of about 75,000 pieces of pipe fittings per year. The projected demand is much larger than the capacity of the domestic plant. Hence for the purpose of substituting imports, one or two plants have to be established to meet the current and future demand of metallic fittings. With the growth of the construction industry, it is inevitable that the demand for metallic fittings will also grow. The Amhara region can take advantage of this market opportunity by establishing a plant which will produce metallic fittings. ',

'The major raw materials are brass scrap, copper ignots, brass bars and tubes, electroplating chemicals such as nicked chloride, nickel sulphate, chrome salt and sulphuric acid. Most of these of raw materials will be imported. Brass scrap could be collected locally.  ', 

'The production process can be classified into four stages-casting, machining, electroplating and assembling. Brass is used to produce the main component. Gravity die casting technique is employed to produce value body, bonnet and other parts that can be easily produced by casting. The die (mould) used in this case is made from cast-iron and is permanent. The casting process begins with melting the brass ignot and scrap in a furnace (induction furnace in this case). After melting the metal is tapped into a ladle and the ladle is carried to the pouring station where the molten brass is poured into a metal die (mould). After cooling, the die and the castings are separated by splitting apart the two parts of the mould. The castings separated from the die have spruces, runners, and gates which have to be removed and reclaimed for remelting for reuse. This operation is called fettling. It is done in various ways-hammering, tubing and grinding. After fettling, the castings are sent to the machine shop for machinery parts such as the tags body, handle, bounet, sleeve, shower-head and knob. The machining operation includes facing, chambering, boring, drilling, taping and threading on all openings and grinding and polishing on all lapped surfaces.

In addition to die cast components, there are other sanitary fitting parts which require machining. These are mechanical components from free cutting brass such as spindle, seal holder, connecting foods, tubes and nuts. Producing these parts requires cutting the brass bar, facing, chambering threading, grinding and polishing. The next major manufacturing stage is chrome plating. But before plating, the die cast components have to undergo physical and chemical cleaning. Physical cleaning is carried out by rough and smooth grinding accompanied by primary and fine polishing. Chemical cleaning removes lubrication oil, greases oxides, dirt, metallic particles and abrasives that might have contaminated the cast components during fabrication. Chemical  cleaning involves primary degreasing, pickling in water solution of acids, chemical degreasing by water solutions of salts and alkalic and activation  by dipping the components in 10 percent water solution of sulphuric acid. After the cleaning processes, decorative plating is applied directly by dipping the components into the proper electrolytic solution containing chromic anhydride and proper current density. Finally the components are assembled, tested for leakages and packed. Types of machinery and equipment required include molding and Core making, melting furnace, shot blasting, polishing and buffing equipment, machine shop, electroplating plant, assembling line and testing equipment.

' ',
' About 25-30 years ago, it was only houses in the main urban centers that used corrugated and galvanized iron sheets for roofing material. Almost all houses in the rural areas used special types of grasses or straws to cover their roofs. As a result there was only one corrugated iron sheet factory in the whole country up to the end of the 1990’s. During the last 10 years, people in rural areas have started using corrugated and galvanized iron sheets for roofing purposes. They use these iron sheets as a sign of prestige and also for security against fire. Now it is common to see houses in rural areas covered with corrugated iron sheets. This trend is increasing every year. Some rural families even use money they borrowed from the State for income generating activities to buy corrugated iron sheets for their houses. Because of this new trend, demand for corrugated iron sheet has increased greatly. To meet this new demand, one or two new factories are established and the finished product is also being imported. 

In the Amhara Region demand for corrugated iron sheets have been also increasing. One corrugated iron sheets producing factory was established in combolcha. But its production volume is not sufficient to meet the demand of the Region. In fact, the Region imports huge quantities of these products from other parts of the country and from abroad and this situation will continue until the Region creates its own capacity of producing enough quantity of the product. 
	
	In rural Amhara alone, there are abut 3.6 million housing units. Currently not more than one percent of these housing units have corrugated iron sheets as roof covers. This leaves abut 3.56 million housing units with thatched roofs. If we assume that one housing unit is about 50 m2, total size of rural houses in the Amhara Region with thatched roof will be about 178,000,000 m2. For a one m2 floor space one corrugated iron sheet is required as a roofing material. Hence the total potential demand for corrugated iron sheets in the Amhara Region can be 178 million pieces. If ten percent of this demand is realized, about 18 million pieces of corrugated iron sheets will be needed. ',

' Local factories import the iron sheets. So will the new plant to be established in the Amhara Region. ',

' Once the iron sheets are obtained, the process of converting them into corrugating and galvanized iron sheets only requires corrugating and galvanizing. Corrugating is done using special machines and subjecting the flat iron sheets to certain loads. Galvanizing is done by submerging the iron sheets in a “pool” of “liquid” zinc with electric current passing through the “liquid” zinc. ',

The use of water meter (or flow meter) in each household, and factory, commercial and other buildings not only permit an accurate recording of the actual volume of water used by the consuming unit, but also helps in efficient utilization and conservation of water.  ', 
' ',
'The demand for water flow meter is related with the expansion of piped water supply, which in turn depends on the rate of urbanization in a given country. About 15 percent of the populations (11.25 million) of Ethiopia live in "urban" areas. With 5 people in a family, about 2.25 million families are "urban" residents. In ideal situation, each urban family could be provided with piped water which means there will be a water flow meter for each family. Total units of water flow meters for urban families in the country would be close to 2.25 million. If we add another 25 percent for other water consuming bodies in the urban areas such as schools, hospitals, hotels, etc, the overall total of water flow meters will be 2.76 million units. This is the potential national demand for water flow meters. However, not all urban families in the country are provided with piped water. Probably only 70-80 percent use piped water. Even those with piped water do not all have water flow meters for each family. For example in 1994, only 140,000 families (out of 440,000) had water flow meters in Addis Ababa. This was only 30 percent of the total family units in the city. The figure is much lower in other urban centers. But during the last 10 years, infrastructures in utilities (power, water supply, telephone, etc) have been expanding in almost all parts of the country. The expansion of piped water systems will require the installation of water flow meters for the efficient use of the water and effective revenue collection. This means that the demand for water flow meters will increase to match the existing and future piped water distribution systems. Unsatisfied demand for the gadget is more than one million units. To meet this unsatisfied demand, 100,000 units have to be either produced at home or be imported. If local production is competitive both in quality and price, there is a big captive market for water flow meters in the country. ',

However, in the parts of the Region mentioned, there is surplus raw which is usually left on the farm.  Part of this straw could be collected and processed to produce paper. ',

'Total import of paper in 2004 was about 155,000 tons and domestic production was 8,400 tons.  Of this quantity, the share of the Amhara Region was about 49,000 tons.  The Amhara Region obtains its paper requirement either from imports or from other parts of the country.  Production of paper from straw will partially meet the paper demand of the Region. ',

'The principle raw material is straw and this will be collected from wheat, barley and rice growing localities of the Region.  Chemicals which will be used to convert straw to pulp and paper will be imported. ',

'Two major stages in the process- pulping and paper making.  In pulping the following operations take place:- Chopping of the straw, dusting, cooking diluting and screening over a vibrating mesh screen; washing and cleaning bleaching is another major step in the production process followed by stock preparation, paper making end finishing operations.  Major plant sand machinery include more than 50 pieces of machines and instrument which are too many to list here. ',

('Printing Plant',

'main products of a printing plant are books, journals, news-papers, and all other printed materials with large volume of copies. ',

'There are two small printing plants (one in Gondar and one in Bahir Dar) in the Amhara Region.  There might be other mini “printing “plants” in the Region.  All the existing plants only produce some newspapers, pamphlets, posters, brochures etc.  They do not have the capacity (both in terms of scale or technology) to produce books of very large copies.  For example, none of the printing plants can print text books required by the Regions student population.  As a result, all text books (for elementary, secondary and preparatory schools) are produced in Addis Ababa.  In principle, if the market justifies it, the Region should be self-sufficient in all industrial products. 
Thus a printing plant with enough capacity and modern technology should be established in the Region for making the Region self-sufficient in all its printing needs especially in printing text books for the Region’s elementary and secondary students. ',

',Due to the absence of a large and modern printing plant, the printing demand for all kinds of books in the Region are met by the printing industry in Addis Ababa.  If we take the case of text books printing, the need of a modern printing will be plant in the Region becomes obvious.  In the school year of 2003/04, there were 2.02 million elementary and about 112,000 secondary school students in the Region.  If we assume that about 8 text books are distributed for two students, the text book need of the Region is about 9,248,000.  If we assume that one book will serve four at least for years, this means that every four year, another 9,248,000 text books will be needed in the Region and this is without considering the increase in student population. ',

'The main materials needed for printing are paper and ink; and these products are mostly imported. ',
'The printing industry is one of those industries where technology is changing fast.  Machinery and equipment needed are- heave duty chromatronics cutter modes, graphic camera modes, offset duplicator, numbering machine, laminating machine, losser writer, Xerox blue print copies, stripping full size right table, paper drill, wire sticker, IMS mini computer, etc. ',

(  ' Paper Ruling Plant',

'Ruled papers both in horizontal and squared forms are used extensively through out the country.  The purpose of this project idea is to manufacture ruled and squared foolscap papers by using a ruling machine with flexography printing process for use in schools, offices, shops and similar establishments.  Ruled and squared papers are produced by ruling both sides of a sheet of paper and cut to a standard size.  The product is mostly supplied in a packet containing 240 sheets (1.65 kgs.) ',

'All paper producing factories are located in Addis Ababa.  Like so many other industrial products, the Amhara Region receives its paper supplies from Addis Ababa- paying unnecessary transport costs which results in higher prices paid by consumers in the Region.  Most of the paper produced in the country is made from imported pulp; and ruling paper is a simple mechanical operations which can be done in any city.  In the long run the Amhara Region must find its way to produce its paper consumption either from regional resources and/ or from imported inputs in any Region.  In the short run, the Region should rule the paper it uses; and for this it needs to establish a paper ruling plant. ',

'More than 80 percent of the paper used in the Amhara Region is ruled paper.  The 2.3 million elementary and secondary students in the Region use ruled paper.  On the average, one student consumes about one kg of ruled paper in a year.  Consumption by 2.3 million students is about 23000 quintals of ruled paper.  Consumption by the general population could not be less than consumption by students.  So total annual consumption could be 46000 quintals.  This market size will make a paper ruling plant viable. ',

'Plain paper is the raw material.  At the country level plain paper is partly imported and partly locally produced.  The Amhara Region will import its plain paper needs partly from Addis Ababa and partly from abroad. ',

'The most common process is a reel to sheet printing technique using a flexographic process which allows both sides of the paper to be printed (ruled) at the same time when the paper passes through two ruling heads which are covered with engraved rubber cylinders.  The printed paper is then cut at the required lengths.  Finally the sheets are packed. ',

('Envelops and Other Paper Bags Making Plant',

'Paper envelops and other paper bags are important components of stationary products.  They are used for packing, letters, documents and other written materials for sending them to other places.  Paper bags are common packaging materials used by many types of businesses ',

'Apart from some type of paper bags such as “khaki” envelops, most envelops are produced in the country by importing the papers.  All envelop production takes place in Addis Ababa.  Other parts of the country including the Amhara Region get their envelop need from Addis Ababa.  This causes the transfer of financial resources from areas outside Addis Ababa to Addis Ababa which could be avoided if the products are made in the Regions.  As a self sufficiency measure, the Amhara Region should produce its envelops and other paper bags requirement in the Region. ',

'With a population of 19 million and an economy which  contributes about 20 percent of the country’s GDP, one can safely assume about the existence of a sufficient market that will make an envelop and other paper bags making plant a viable venture. ',
'Some types of papers that could be used for making envelops and other paper bags can be obtained from local factories.  But for the more quality envelops and other paper bags, papers have to be imported. ',
'The main production process includes the following:-  Printing, cutting, creasing, folding, gluing and packing.  Main machinery include automatic blank fed envelop making machine fitted with flexographic printing units, drying unit, automatic printing units, drying unit, automatic section feeder, sheet separator, glueing and folding attachments with accessories, die cutting machine, etc. ',

(' Toilet Paper (Rolls and Sheets) Making Plant',

' Toilet papers (in rolls or sheets) are becoming essential or basic consumer products because their use can protect people from illness like eases hernia or hemorage.  Toilet papers can be manufactured by converting waste paper such as newspapers or by using straws and other similar raw materials. ',
 
' The use of toilet papers is not unfortunately, very common.  It is only used by a small section of the urban population.  There is one main reason for this.  Most people cannot afford to buy the kind of toilet papers being produced now.  Considering the income level of the majority of the population, the prices of toilet papers are expensive.  The papers are unnecessarily of high quality with fancy colors.  In rural areas people use stones and leaves to clean their bodies instead of toilet papers.  This will cause diseases.  If toilet papers of lower quality (no fancy color, no too much softness) and of lower price are produced and introduced to the rural population, this will reduce the risk of being infected by some diseases.  To improve the hygienic conditions of the people, the production of cheaper toilet papers should be promoted by the concerned agency of the Region.  This project idea is the beginning of this promotion. ',

' Of the 19 million people in the Region, probably about 1.5 million use toilet papers.  The rest use waste paper, stones and leaves in place of toilet papers.  But all of them should have used toilet papers.  For the majority of the people to use toilet papers, the prices must be much lower than they are today.  One factor that causes the prices to be higher than what can be affordable by many people is the quality of the toilet papers being produced today.  For the purpose they are intended to be used, the toilet papers have unnecessarily high quality.  What is needed in the rural areas is a type of toilet paper which is plain in color, probably grey and just a paper that can serve its purpose.  The toilet paper can be made from old newspapers, thrown away used papers, outdated book copies, etc.  From these “raw materials” and using simple technology, it is possible to produce toilet papers which can be bought and used by the “masses”-to used an old term.  The maximum potential consumers for toilet papers of lower prices in the Region could be 17 million.  Even if we assume that only 500,000 people will start using toilet papers; this will certainly justify the establishment of a toilet papers making factory. ',

' If the investor wants to produce toilet papers from waste paper, the input will be available in the country.  If otherwise, the input will be imported. ',

' Waste paper will be sorted and fed into a global digester.  At the same time sodium sulphite, soda ash, etc. are sprinkled over the waste paper.  The digester is then completely closed and rotated.  Next is the charging of the materials into the blow pocher.  Circulation is performed by a proper agitator in the washing drum.  Then the material is transferred into the dump chest from which it is moved up into the head box by pump.  Water is added for dilution.  This is followed by removal of dust, washing and drying, bleaching, washing of the bleaching agent, washing, application of color if necessary, slittering and winding in rolls or cutting into sheets.

('Exercise Book Making Plants ',

'An exercise book is a “book” made from paper sheet layers which are ruled, folded to certain dimensions, stapled and trimmed. It is used for writing. Exercise books are usually produced in different sizes (length, width and number of leaves). The most common exercise books have 24, 32 or 50 leaves. In our country and probably in other countries too, exercise books are used by students. Hence the demand for exercise books depends largely on the number of students a region or a country has at a given period of time. ',

'Over 2.3 million students were enrolled from grades 1-10 in the Amhara Region in 2004. There are also students in Grade 11 and 12 as will as in vocational training centers, colleges and universities. If we add these and evening students, the current student population of the Amhara Region could reach around 2.6 million. All these students need exercise books. If we assume that one student uses, on the average, 20 exercise books per school year annual demand for exercise books will be 52 million. If we add other miscellaneous demand for the product, say 5 percent of the student demand, annual regional demand for exercise books will be in the range of 54.6 million. All these exercise books are imported from Addis Ababa or from abroad through Addis Ababa. The technology of producing exercise books is simple. It only requires, assembling ruled paper sheets, cutting them to required dimensions, folding them stapling and trimming. These can be done any where. If this is the case, the Amhara Region should have its exercise books producing plant to be sel-sufficient in the product of this vital product. ',

'The potential market for exercise books is around 55 million in the Amhara Region. This demand volume is more than the production capacity of five or more exercise books producing plants.  ',

'Wood free writing paper, printing ink, cover sheets, stitching wire are the raw materials needed for making exercise books. Apart from the stitching wire, the other raw materials will be obtained from domestic sources. ',

'The production process begins by conveying an end-less ribbon of paper via unwinding unit into a printing and ruling machine. The paper is lined (made to have lines) there according to the intended use (mathematics or other subjects). Then the ribbon is cut into sheet layers by means of a rotary cross cutter according to the width of the exercise book. These sheets layers are counted and stacked. In parallel to the sheet layers production the covers are automatically conveyed to the production flow. Then the sheet layers and covers are stapled, folded and pressed. The exercise books so made still have longitudinal size equal to the width of the paper ribbon, minimum 350mm and maximum 720mm. Therefore, they are cut down to their regular size by a cutting unit. The stacking and packing of the finished exercise books. Machinery and equipment required include unwinding unit, printing and ruling machine, rotary cross cutter, counting and collecting unit, stack sheet feeder, wire stitching, folding and spine squaring unit, separation unit, collecting and discharge unit',

(' Carbon Paper Making Plant',

' Carbon paper is used to copy two or more copies either by using hard pencil, ball pen or typewriter.  It is mainly used in offices where there are financial transactions in one way or another or in places where there are no computers and photocopiers. ',

'The advent of computers, printers and photocopiers had decreased the demand of carbon papers.  However, there are still many types of paper works which require the use of carbon papers.  All types of activities which involve the transfer of money and other kinds of property require the use of carbon paper for preparing receipts and other associated documents.  In our country, still there are many office works which need carbon paper.  And this is especially true at the lower levels of the government structures and in areas outside the national and regional capitals.  In the private sector, practically all types of money and property transfers require carbon paper for preparing documents which are instrumental for the transfer.  This implies that there is a big demand for carbon papers in the country.  This demand will continue to exist until such a time that the whole paperwork business is completely done by computers, printers and photo copiers, and that time is relatively far-off in the context of the Ethiopian economy.  Until that “time” arrives, we will use carbon papers.  And there is a need to produce carbon papers at home. ',

'Four types of carbon papers constitute the largest share of carbon paper consumption.  These are one time carbon, typewriter carbon, pencil carbon and special carbon.  All the carbon requirement of the country is met by imports and the annual import volume of this product is much greater than the minimum scale production capacity of a carbon paper making plant-which is about 10 million pieces or 108,000 boxes per year.  For one-time carbon paper, a small plant had been established near Addis Ababa in the late 1980’s.  This plant had a small portion of the domestic market, but it had some quality problems compared to the imported carbon paper.  Currently the product of this local plant is not available widely probably indicating some basic problems due to poor quality.  Any attempt to produce carbon paper should pay attention to the quality of the product which depends mainly on the level of production technology, quality of raw material and technical know-how of labor. ',

'To be imported. ',

'In general preparation of carbon paper involves the following.  These are preparation of paper base ink preparation and application of ink on paper.  As a base paper or carrier for satisfactory carbon paper, various types of special carbonizing tissues have been developed such as craft and sulfites tissue.  Carbonizing tissues are generally available in weights ranging from 4 to 16 pounds per ream.  The ink is applied on the tissue paper by a special machine called carbon paper coater.  The machine can apply the ink either on one side or both sides as per design.  The carbon papers are rolled on chilled rollers and packed. 
List of plant and machinery include mixing machine, ball mill, triple roll mill, storage tanks, automatic coating machine, rewinding machine, paper printing machine for back printing, paper cutting machine packing machine, boiler and chilled water plant',

('Corrugated Board and Boxes Making Plant',

'Corrugated board consists of board built up by gluing a flat sheet on one or both sides of a corrugated paper or medium.  These are made of kraft paper with regular curved folds and greaves.  Corrugated boxes are made from corrugated boards.  The boxes are used as packaging materials for industrial goods. ',

'Though the level of industrial development in the Amhara Region is at a very low stage, there are some factories which require corrugated boxes for packaging their products.  Some of the industrial products which require corrugated boxes for packaging include printed materials, food products such as biscuits, nails, shoes, yarn, edible oil, etc.  The corrugated boxes used to package and other products are brought from other parts of the country.  The packaging industry develops with the expansion of other industrial sectors.  For the products currently produced and for products to be produced in the future, there is a need to establish a small corrugated board and box plant in the Amhara Region. ',

'During the initial period of operation, say five years, the craft paper used for making corrugated board and box will be imported.  With the development of the paper industry in the Region, the craft paper will be produced in the Region to supply the corrugated board plant with the necessary “raw material”. ',

'Between 2000 and 2004, average annual production of corrugated box was 2,530 tons.  The share of the Amhara Region was roughly 632 tons.  The technology of producing corrugated board and box is not subject to a high degree of economies of scale.  A plant which can produce 400 tons of corrugated board can be a financially viable plant if production costs are kept to the minimum.  Hence, even the existing demand for corrugated boxes can justify the establishment of a small corrugated box making factory in the Region. ',
'Corrugated board is made of craft paper or straw with regular curved folds and greaves.  It is composed of two structural elements which are (a) the facing or linear board and (b) the fluting structure or corrugated medium.  The linear is used for outer side of the board and the medium for the inner.  The process of producing corrugated board can be summarized as follows.  A kraft liner paper and corrugated medium paper are fed into a corrugated machine.  Before the medium paper comes in contact with corrugating rolls, the rolls are heated to produce a surface temperature of 3200-3400F.  These rolls will heat the corrugated medium when it comes in contact with the rolls.  This heat treatment makes the paper soft and pliable so that uniform flutings are produced.  On leaving the corrugating rolls, the corrugating medium comes in contact with glue applicator roll which applies adhesive to tips of flutes formed by the rolls.  After the application of the glue, the first liner is brought into contact with the glue tips and then wound in roll.  The resulting board is a single face.  For making a double face board, adhesive is applied to the flutes on the other side of the corrugating medium and a second liner is applied.
For manufacturing corrugated box from corrugated boards, the process involves cutting the board, creasing, shearing, corner cutting and stitching.  Main machinery include corrugating machine, board cutter, pasting machine, sheet press, rotary cutting and creasing machine. ',

('Screen Printing Making Plants',

'Screen printing also called silk-screen printing is used for advertising and commercial printing on a wide range of printing stocks such as textiles, glass, plastics, metals and other non-paper surfaces.  It is used for printing posters, window and counter-displays and for a number of industrial items such as radio and instrument dials, electrical circuits, glass bottles, pottery, packages and containers. ',

'In general the printing industry in the Amhara Region is at a very low stage of development compared to the same industry existing in the other major regions of the country.  Within the printing industry, screen printing is almost non-existent in the Region.  Major screen printing works required in the Region are prepared in Addis Ababa and then transported to the Region.  This crates inconvenience in addition to transport cost.  Like other industrial products, the Amhara region should strive to be self-sufficient in the screen printing industry.  This project idea is the beginning to promote the establishment of a screen printing industry in the Region. ',

'The products of screen printing are not like normal industrial products which are produced and sold in the market.  Screen printing is basically a service giving operation.  Customers bring their orders or messages to be printed.  The printers then prepare the design and the medium material and do the printing work.  This is why printing is a service operation.  Screen printing is mostly for commercial printing.  During the last ten years, commercial activities have greatly increased in the Amhara Region.  In big and small urban centers of the Region, many types of business enterprises are opened.  All the new enterprises need different types of screen printing to promote/advertise their businesses products and services; and this need will increase with the expansion of business activities.  The current and the future need for screen printing in the Region will sustain the viability of a number of small scale screens printing in the Region. ',

'Screen printing requires ink and the material to print on.  Such materials include textile, glass, plastic, metals, etc.  Textile will be obtained from domestic sources, the rest will be imported. ',

'In screen printing process, a stencil representing the non-printing areas is applied to a silk, nylon or stainless-steel fine mesh screen to which ink with consistency of paint is applied and transformed to the surface to be printed by scrapping with rubber squeeze.  The stencils are generally made in one of the three ways by cutting out the design on paper film; by photographing the image on sensitized gelatine; and by painting the matter on the screen with an ink and water resistant lacquer.  The screen is mounted on a frame which is hinged to base that holds the stock to be printed.  The article to be printed is placed beneath the screen and ink is forced by a “squeeze” through the screen either by hand or by machine. ',

('Gummed Paper (Other than Stamps) Producing Plant',

'A gummed paper tape consists of gum applied on one side of the tape and the other side is some time printed to give a better look. By applying water to the gummed side of paper it can be used for sealing, sticking and pasting purposes. It is mainly used in packing and sealing corrugated and solid fibre board containers, paper boxes, paper cartons and small packages. Printed gummed papers are often used for decoration, stenciling of names ands designs on metal, glass and plastics. It is ideal for it can be positioned in the printing operation and provides clean sharp edges to the printed designs. ',


'The use of gummed paper is directly related with the size of an economy and its rate of growth. Though the Ethiopian economy is not large by the standards of developed countries, it is an economy that consumes a consider able quantity of gummed paper. All the gummed paper requirement of the country is met by imports. But the product can easily be produced at home with modest investment, and simple and conventional technology. Like many other imported industrial products, it is a mystery why investors have not looked into the opportunity of producing, gummed paper in the country. This project idea is to trigger the interest of potential investors so that they could establish a plant to produce gummed paper. ',

'About 600 rolls of gummed paper per day is believed to be the minimum plant capacity. This amounts to and annual production capacity of 180,000 rolls. The country’s economy can absorb/utilize this quantity and possibly more. ',

'The main raw materials are craft paper and adhesives. The Kraft paper can be obtained from domestic sources, while the adhesives will be imported until such a time that they are produced at home. ',

'The process can be divided in to five steps. Breaking of the glue flakes, glue preparation, glue costing, drying of the coated paper and slitting and rewinding. ',

('Printing Ink Making Plant',

'The ink used in the printing industry is known as printing ink. It is applied to paper through printing machine in the form of a thin film. The film consists of individual letters, isolated designs and solid areas separated by blank unprinted spaces. Printing ink is essentially an intimate mixture of pigments, oils, varnishes, driers and some other additives. Printing ink must posses suitable physical characteristics such as viscosity, length and flow and it should be possible to adopt it for the particular type of printing press and stock which it is to be used. Printing inks are divided into three main classes which are: Planographic printing ink, typographic printing ink and intaglio printing ink. Plano graphic inks are used to print from plane surfaces as in lithographic and offset processes. These are generally heavier and shorter in characteristic. The pigments and vehicles used in these inks must not be affected by water. Typographic inks are used to print from a raised surface such as ordinary type with line and half one cuts. These inks are very long i.e. they may be drawn out in fairly long threads. Typographic prints are of four types automatic press ink, job press ink, flat bed press ink and sheet fed rotary press ink. Intaglio printing ink are originally called steel or copper plate inks and are used to print from engraved or depressed surfaces. The character of the ink depends upon to kinds of plate, the type of press being used and the speed of operation. ',

'There are more than two hundred small and large printing plants in the country. Most of these were established during the last 10 years. With the expansion of elementary and secondary education in the country, the printing demand especially the book printing demand has greatly increased. In 2004, there were more than 11 million students in elementary and secondary schools; all these students require books of different subject for their education. This is one important indicator of the expansion of the printing industry. This also shows the increase in demand for printing inks. However despite all this huge market for printing ink, the product is still being imported consuming a substantial amount of foreign exchange every year. The expansion of the printing business has resulted in the establishment of many printing plants. 

Another result of this situation should be the establishment of a plant that will produce printing ink for the expanding printing industry. ',

'As indicated above, for the expanding printing industry the demand for printing ink per year could be measured in the hundreds of tons. The minimum economy of scale for producing printing ink is in the region of 100 kgs. Per day or about 27.5 tons per year. There is a market whose absorption capacity is greater than 27.5 tons per year. Hence, establishing a printing ink making plant will be a viable venture. ',

'Raw materials used to manufacture printing ink include different types of inputs which can be generally classified as organic and inorganic pigments, oils resins, driers, solvents and diluents, waxes, and surface active agents. Each group of inputs performs different functions in the making of a given type of printing ink. Almost all the inputs for making printing ink will be imported. However, there is also a high potential for producing some of the ingredient locally. ',
'The process of printing ink manufacturing is simple. First the various ingredients are mixed together as per given formulation and the mass is ground (made into powder). While mixing, initially a semi-viscous paste is prepared by mixing pigment in same amount of vehicle and then in this paste other ingredients are added. This mixing operation is carried out either in paddle mixer or dough mixer. The next step is grinding of paste which is generally done in water cooled three or five roller mills or pebble mill. Since heat is generated during the operation, water cooling is required to remove the heat. When the printing ink material has been ground in paste or semi-paste form, the vehicle or solvent is incorporated for mixing the finished product. For this change can mixer is often used. Finally the product is packed in suitable containers with the help of a felling machine. 
Major machinery units required include storage tank for solvent, grinder, mixer, storage tank for ink, miscellaneous such as pipes, pipe fittings, etc and filling and packaging machine',

'Average annual import of paper products between 1985 and 1994 was 10,832 tons or 10.832 million kgs. Average annual foreign exchange expenditure for the paper products was Birr 27.42 million. Domestic Production of paper products between 2000 and 2004 was about 9700 tons per year on the average. Projected demand for paper products was estimated to be 55100 tons for 2006 and 101000 tons for 2015. This shows that there is plenty of space to substitute imports by domestic production. ',

'The main raw materials for repulped waste paper are cotton/hosiery rags, waste paper, agro-fibres (straw, bagasse…) other additives ( caustic soda, bleaching powder). All these raw materials can be obtained from local sources. The fact that these raw materials can be found in the country is an encouraging factor to produce repulped waste paper locally. ',

'The main production processes are preliminary treatment, beating, and sheet formation, pressing, peeling, drying, calendaring and packing. In the pretreatment unit, cotton rags are cut into small bits with power operated rag choppers. In the case of agro-fibers, the material, after chopping, is cooked in a small open digester with low percentage of alkali. Cut and dusted rags are beaten to pulp stock in small power operated Hollander beater with or without bleaching. The material is washed by means of a washer drum followed by further beating. Addition of normal fillers/loadings and dyeing and sitting chemical as required for the end product is also accomplished during beating. Sheet formation is carried out by draining water from a dilute fibre mix through a fine screen and both dry the mat thus formed by dewatering with rollers, drying on heated rolls, and smoothing with calendars. The calendared paper is hand sorted, edges trimmed with the help of power operated cutting machine and packed.  Main machinery and equipment needed include open digester, rag chopper, beater, Hollander beater with drum washer and accessories, auto Kats with pair of moulds and stock pump. ',

('Sanitary Napkin Making Plants',

'Sanitary napkin is a product used by women during their menstrual periods. This sanitary product can be made either from cotton only or from a combination of absorbent paper, water proof paper, crushed pulp and non- woven cloth or rayon paper. Absorbent cotton is found to limit bodily movement considerably and it is not also very comfortable to use. Besides, it is expensive. Sanitary napkin which is made from absorbent paper, water proof paper, crushed pulp, etc. has largely replaced absorbent cotton for handling menstruation. Sanitary napkin is clean; it is easy to carry around; and it is thrown away once used. The need of establishing an absorbent cotton making plant is identified in another project idea. This project idea is to give another project idea for producing a product for the same purpose but to be made from different raw materials. ',
' ',

'In 2006, there are about 4.6 million women in the Amhara Region who are in the reproductive age group. These women are the potential consumers of sanitary napkins. But up to now only women in the urban areas use sanitary napkins during their menstruation periods. Probably due to lack of awareness, women in the rural areas do not use sanitary napkins. And this creates so much inconvenience and many a time embarrassment for many women. With proper introduction of the product to rural markets and with effective awareness creation about the benefits of sanitary napkins, practically all rural women of reproductive age will want to use the napkins. Of the 4.6 million women of reproductive age group in the region, about 4.1 million live in rural areas. If 30 percent of these women use sanitary napkins, total number of consumers in rural areas will be 1.2 million women, If one woman uses about 4 pieces of sanitary napkins per menstruation cycle, total annual demand for this product will be 57.6 million pieces (1.2 mill. X 4 x 12 months). This estimated demand is for 30 percent of rural women of reproductive age.

The pin is also used for holding a small collection of papers by piercing them together.  Gem clips and paper pins are used extensively in all areas where there is paper work. ',

'All the gem clips and paper pins requirement of the Amhara region are imported from abroad through Addis Ababa.  With the establishment of new offices and other institutions in the region due to the decentralization of the administrative structure of the country, the consumption of office stationary materials like gem clips and paper pins has increased.  The consumption of gem clips and paper pins in the Region will be sufficient to absorb the production of a small gem clips and paper pins producing plant.  To promote self-sufficiency in these products and to save regional financial resources, the establishment of a gem clips and paper pins making plant must be promoted. ',

'Since all gem clips and paper pins which the country requires are all imported, production of these stationary items in the country will be an import substitution exercise.  It is a change in the supply source to meet an existing demand.  The consumption volume of gem clips and paper pins in the Amhara Region constitutes about 25 percent of the total consumption of the country.

' ',

'Paper products are used for a variety of purposes for writing, printing, duplicating, packaging and for other industrial and commercial uses. Currently the demand for paper in the country is met both from domestic production and imports. Consumption of a paper in a country depends on the level of economic development, the level of literacy rate of the population, on the development of the publishing and printing industry, the size of student population at primary, secondary and tertiary level. Generally least developed countries have the lowest level of per capita paper consumption. In Ethiopia, per capita consumption of paper is estimated to be between 0.5 kg to 1.0 kg per year, while in advanced countries the consumption level is move than 100 kgs per year. Even the low level of paper consumption in Ethiopia is not fully met by domestic production. According to a study made on the market for paper products, the demand for paper is projected to reach 148,000 tons in 2011. However, the current domestic production is about 17,000 tons per year. This clearly indicates that there is large captive market for paper in the country. This project idea is to exploit part of this captive market by establishing a plant which can produce hand made paper. ',

'The main raw materials are waste paper, textile cuttings, agricultural waste, grass, caustic soda, bleaching powder and other chemicals. Almost all materials can be obtained from domestic sources. ',

In paper factories these bobbins and tubes are use for winding rolls of paper of different uses. Also in textile factories, they are used for winding rolls of finished fabrics. The textile, paper and the fiber factories are the main users of paper bobbins and tubes in our country. Although the technology of producing these products is relatively simple, they are still being imported to meet the demand of the above industries. As the numbers of textile and fiber factories are increasing, the demand for paper bobbins and tubes increases. Currently the demand is estimated to be around 5000 tons and the share of the textile factories in the Amhara Region is about 2000 tons. As paper bobbins and tubes are very light in weight, 2000 tons is a huge quantity. This demand size could justify the establishment of a plant which will produce paper bobbins and tubes. Excess supply could be exported to other regions.    ',

'As the name indicates, paper bobbins and tubes are made from craft or kahki paper of relatively low quality. This input could be secured from the two paper factories of the country. ',

'Narrow paper webs which are necessary for tube winding are cut on a slitter/rewinder. The webs for the winder are drawn from unwind-stand. The paper rolls are mounted one after the other. The webs run over guides through the gluing equipment to the winding machine. The inside paper webs are glued in a glue bath while the bottom web and cover web are either glued in a single gluing units. The essential element of tube manufacturing is the spiral winding machine. Here the glued strips are led onto a fixed mandrel. A winding belt wraps itself one turning around the mandrel. Once the tube is formed, it is cut to the desired length by a forward moving saw or score-cut knife. The tubes are then taken to a combined labeling and cutting machine. There it will first be wrapped with a multi-pattern picture label and then cut into the required number of tubes by means of several cutting knives. Machinery required for the plant includes slitter rewinder, unwinding stand with gluing equipment, cutt-off device, tube re-cutting machine.   ',
